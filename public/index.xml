      <description>What is Linux? linkThe Linux kernel was created by Linus Torvalds in 1991. It becomes an operating system with the addition of components like a package manager, desktop environment, shell, and bootloader.&#xA;As an open-source OS, Linux offers numerous customizations. Each unique combination of these customizations is called a distribution or &amp;ldquo;distro.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;There are hundreds, if not thousands, of distros worldwide, each optimized for specific purposes or created just for fun by enthusiasts.</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/tutorials/docs/linux-basics-for-hackers/linux-basics-for-hackers/bash_scripting/</guid>
      <description>Any self-respecting hacker must be able to script. For that matter, any self-respecting Linux administrator must be able to script. With the arrival of the Windows PowerShell, Windows administrators are increasingly required to script as well to perform automated tasks and be more efficient.&#xA;As a hacker, we often need to automate the use of multiple commands, sometimes from multiple tools. To become an elite hacker, you not only need to have advanced shell scripting skills, but also the ability to script in one of the widely-used scripting languages such as Ruby (Metasploit exploits are written in Ruby), Python (many hacking tools are Python scripts), or Perl (Perl is the best text manipulation scripting language).</description>

      <description>What Is Browser Exploitation? linkBrowser exploitation involves leveraging security vulnerabilities in a web browser to perform unauthorized actions. This can include a range of techniques aimed at gaining control over the browser or the system on which it&amp;rsquo;s running, or to steal sensitive information. The basic principle behind browser exploitation is that a web browser, like any software, can have flaws or vulnerabilities in its code, which may cause the browser to behave in unintended ways.</description>

      <title>Introduction to BeEF: The Browser Exploitation Framework</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/tutorials/docs/beef/beef/introduction_to_beef/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/tutorials/docs/beef/beef/introduction_to_beef/</guid>
      <description>BeEF, the Browser Exploitation Framework, is an indispensable tool for ethical hackers aiming to identify and exploit vulnerabilities within web browsers. While many security tools concentrate on system or server-side vulnerabilities, BeEF zeroes in on the client side—specifically, the user&amp;rsquo;s web browser. This focus is crucial because, regardless of the security measures implemented on a network or operating system, vulnerabilities in a web browser can still provide a gateway for attackers to infiltrate the system.</description>

      <description>Assuming you now have Metasploit installed, run the msfconsole command to open Metasploit:&#xA;Finding Modules linkMetasploit is based around the concept of modules. The most commonly used module types are:&#xA;Auxiliary - Auxiliary modules do not exploit a target, but can perform data gathering or administrative tasks Exploit - Exploit modules leverage vulnerabilities in a manner that allows the framework to execute arbitrary code on the target host Payloads - Arbitrary code that can be executed on a remote target to perform a task, such as creating users, opening shells, etc Post - Post modules are used after a machine has been compromised.</description>

      <description>In Linux, nearly everything you deal with directly is a file, and most often these will be text files. For instance, all configuration files in Linux are text files. To reconfigure an application, you simply open the configuration file, change the text, save the file, and then restart the application—your reconfiguration is complete. With so many text files, manipulating text becomes crucial in managing Linux and Linux applications. In this chapter, you’ll use several commands and techniques for manipulating text in Linux.</description>

      <description>Linux employs a robust system to manage file access control. This system determines who can read, write, and execute any given file. It grants the file owner control over these permissions, allowing them to specify who can access their files. Group permissions can also be configured to manage access for specific user groups.&#xA;Viewing File Permissions&#xA;The ls command with the -l (long listing) option displays detailed information about files, including their permissions.</description>
