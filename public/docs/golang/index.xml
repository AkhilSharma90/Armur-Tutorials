      <description>Introduction:&#xA;Hello, Go developers! Error handling is a critical component of robust application development. Unlike many programming languages that use exceptions for error handling, Go uses a distinct approach that encourages explicit error checking, which can lead to more reliable and understandable code. In this blog, we&amp;rsquo;ll dive deep into Go&amp;rsquo;s error handling strategies, exploring how to handle errors effectively, create and use custom errors, and utilize Go&amp;rsquo;s defer, panic, and recover mechanisms to manage exceptional situations gracefully.</description>
