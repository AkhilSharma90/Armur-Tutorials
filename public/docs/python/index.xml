      <title>Understanding Python Variables and Data Types: From Basics to Type Conversion</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/tutorials/docs/python/python/variables_and_data_types/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/tutorials/docs/python/python/variables_and_data_types/</guid>
      <description>Introduction linkIn Python, a variable is a container for storing data values. Unlike other programming languages that require explicit declaration to reserve memory space, Python variables do not need explicit declaration to reserve memory. Memory allocation happens automatically when you assign a value to a variable.&#xA;Numbers, Strings, and Booleans linkNumbers linkPython supports various numeric types including integers, floating-point numbers, and complex numbers:&#xA;Integers (int) are whole numbers, positive or negative, without decimals, of unlimited magnitude.</description>
