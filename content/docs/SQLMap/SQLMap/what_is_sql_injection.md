### What is SQL Injection (SQLi)?

SQL Injection (SQLi) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries an application makes to its database. This can enable an attacker to view or manipulate data that they normally cannot access. In severe cases, SQL injection can be used to compromise the underlying server or back-end infrastructure, leading to significant data breaches, reputational damage, and regulatory fines.

### Impact of SQL Injection

A successful SQL injection attack can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, such as:

- User passwords
- Credit card details
- Personal user information

SQL injection attacks have been used in many high-profile data breaches, causing substantial damage. In some cases, attackers can establish a persistent backdoor into an organization's systems, leading to prolonged and undetected compromises.

## Detecting SQL Injection Vulnerabilities

### Manual Detection Techniques

You can manually detect SQL injection vulnerabilities by systematically testing every entry point in the application. Common techniques include:

1. **Single Quote Test:**
   - Submit a single quote character (`'`) and look for errors or anomalies.
2. **SQL-Specific Syntax Tests:**
   - Use syntax that evaluates to the same value (e.g., `1=1`) and look for differences in responses.
3. **Boolean Conditions:**
   - Inject conditions like `OR 1=1` and `OR 1=2` and observe response differences.
4. **Time-Based Payloads:**
   - Inject payloads designed to trigger time delays and observe response times.
5. **Out-of-Band Network Interaction:**
   - Use OAST (Out-of-band Application Security Testing) payloads to trigger network interactions.

### Automated Detection

Tools like Burp Scanner can quickly and reliably detect SQL injection vulnerabilities, reducing the need for manual testing.

## Exploiting SQL Injection Vulnerabilities

### Common SQL Injection Techniques

SQL injection vulnerabilities can occur in different parts of a SQL query. Here are some common types:

1. **Retrieving Hidden Data:**
   - Modify a SQL query to return additional results.
2. **Subverting Application Logic:**
   - Change a query to interfere with the application's logic.
3. **UNION Attacks:**
   - Retrieve data from different database tables using the `UNION` keyword.
4. **Blind SQL Injection:**
   - Exploit vulnerabilities where the query results are not returned in the application's responses.

### Examples

#### Retrieving Hidden Data

Imagine a shopping application that displays products in different categories. A request to display products in the "Gifts" category might look like this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1
```

An attacker can modify the URL to:

```
https://insecure-website.com/products?category=Gifts'--
```

This results in the query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts'--' AND released = 1
```

The `--` is a comment indicator in SQL, which means the rest of the query is ignored, showing all products including unreleased ones.

#### Subverting Application Logic

In a login system:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'wiener' AND password = 'bluecheese'
```

An attacker can bypass authentication by entering:

```
Username: administrator'--
Password: (blank)
```

Resulting in:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'administrator'--' AND password = ''
```

#### UNION Attacks

Retrieve data from another table:

```sql
SELECT name, description FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts'
```

Modify input to:

```
' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users--
```

Resulting in:

```sql
SELECT name, description FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users--
```

## Advanced SQL Injection Techniques

### Blind SQL Injection

Blind SQL injection occurs when the application does not return query results or error details in its responses. Techniques include:

1. **Boolean-Based Blind SQL Injection:**
   - Change the logic of the query to trigger different responses based on a condition.
2. **Time-Based Blind SQL Injection:**
   - Inject conditions that trigger time delays to infer true/false conditions.
3. **Out-of-Band SQL Injection:**
   - Trigger external network interactions to exfiltrate data.

### Second-Order SQL Injection

Occurs when user input is stored and later used unsafely in a SQL query. For example, an application safely stores user input but later retrieves and uses it without proper validation.

## Preventing SQL Injection

### Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements)

Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection. This technique separates SQL code from data, ensuring user input cannot interfere with query structure.

**Vulnerable Code:**

```java
String query = "SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = '" + input + "'";
Statement statement = connection.createStatement();
ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery(query);
```

**Secure Code:**

```java
PreparedStatement statement = connection.prepareStatement("SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = ?");
statement.setString(1, input);
ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery();
```

### Whitelisting and Input Validation

For parts of the query that cannot use parameterized queries (e.g., table or column names), use whitelisting to validate input against a list of permitted values.

### Additional Best Practices

- **Escape User Input:** Properly escape special characters in user inputs.
- **Use ORM Libraries:** Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) libraries can help mitigate SQL injection by abstracting SQL queries.
- **Least Privilege:** Ensure database accounts have the minimum privileges necessary.

## Conclusion

SQL injection remains one of the most critical security vulnerabilities in web applications. Understanding how to detect, exploit, and prevent SQL injection is crucial for developers, testers, and security professionals. By following best practices such as using parameterized queries and whitelisting, you can significantly reduce the risk of SQL injection attacks.
